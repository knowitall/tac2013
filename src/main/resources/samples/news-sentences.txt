AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	0	58	Chile swine flu cases jump to 276 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	1	167	Chilean health authorities confirmed 26 new cases of swine flu on Sunday, raising the number of patients with A(H1N1) virus in the country to 276, the highest number on the continent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	2	360	The sometimes-deadly disease continued its rise across Latin America meanwhile with Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru and the Dominican Republic all reporting new cases. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	3	538	Officials here said that most of the victims were in the capital, and that most cases were mild and being treated at home. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	4	661	Three people remain in serious condition in hospital, however. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	5	733	Swine flu has killed nearly a hundred and infected over 15,500 worldwide, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, since it emerged in North America in late April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	6	919	According to figures released by individual governments, the virus has actually now killed more than 110 people around the world. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	7	1058	In the southern hemisphere, health experts fear the new virus could take hold, as winter sets in and the regular flu season gets underway. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	8	1206	Argentine health authorities meanwhile reported 15 new cases on Sunday, a day after reporting 20 new cases, raising the country's total patient count to 115. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	9	1373	Officials in Buenos Aires said those with new swine flu infections were recovering well and that most of them were found at several private schools in the capital, where students had recently returned from the United States. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	10	1607	The outbreak has prompted officials to close the schools for two weeks in a bid to contain the virus. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	11	1718	In the Dominican Republic officials confirmed nine cases of the disease, raising the country's total to 11, a day after Santo Domingo rebuffed a Russian claim that the Caribbean island was underreporting its cases in a bid to boost tourism. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	12	1968	"We fear that in reality, the situation is very different," Gennady Onishchenko, Russia's chief sanitary inspector, had told the Interfax news agency in response to the island reporting only two cases. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	13	2179	On Sunday the island's Ministry of Public Health reported that of the nine new cases one had been hospitalized. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	14	2300	In Peru health authorities said they had confirmed two more cases of the virus, bringing the country's total to 40. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	15	2425	Both cases were found in Lima and are recovering well on medication at home, officials said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	16	2527	Brazil also confirmed four new cases, which brought the country's total number to 20. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	17	2622	At its last count at the end of last week Mexican authorities said 97 people had died from the disease and that 4,932 had been infected. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0001	18	2759	Officials however maintained that the epidemic was on the wane there. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	0	58	Basketball: Despite sting of defeat, James says Cavs on right track 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	1	208	National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player LeBron James insisted Sunday that Cleveland were on the right track, despite their painful failure to reach the NBA finals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	2	394	James couldn't bring himself to address the media or congratulate the players of the Orlando Magic on Saturday night, after the Magic defeated the Cavs in game six of the Eastern Conference finals to reach the league's championship series. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	3	643	But as he and teammates gathered for the last team meeting of the season here on Sunday, James tried to put a positive spin on the Cavaliers season. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	4	801	Cleveland notched the best record in the regular season with 66 victories, won their division and swept to victory in four games in each of their first two playoff series. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	5	982	Then they ran into the surprising Magic, who had already ousted reigning champions Boston in seven games, and even "King" James's heroics couldn't save them. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	6	1149	"You want to continue to get better, that's all you can ask," said James, whose team lost to Boston in the conference finals last year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	7	1294	"We got better this season and I feel this team will be better next season. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	8	1370	You don't want to take a step backward. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	9	1410	I thought we went forward from the Boston series to this year and hopefully we can go forward one more time next year." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	10	1539	James certainly did all he could to take his team one step further. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	11	1616	His buzzer-beating 3-pointer saved Cleveland in game two against Orlando. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	12	1690	He had 21 points, 17 in the second half, in game five, a contest that saw him finish with 37 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	13	1828	Now the big question exercising Cleveland - the club's management, his teammates and Cavs fans - is how this defeat will influence his future with the team. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	14	1994	The Cavaliers can offer him a contract extension in July. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	15	2052	He can extend the contract up to four years, or play out his current contract that ends after next season and make a move via free agency. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	16	2191	He could also exercise a player option for the 2010-11 season. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	17	2263	"I haven't thought about it just yet," James said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	18	2314	"I'm just going to take time off from basketball and not think about contracts or the game, period, and relax with my family." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	19	2450	James defended his actions in Orlando on Saturday, when he strode off the court - to a smattering of taunts from Magic fans - without congratulating his opponents. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	20	2623	"I just didn't have much to say," said James, who said he had since e-mailed Orlando star Dwight Howard. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	21	2728	"One thing about me you've got to understand - it is hard for me to congratulate somebody after just losing to him. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	22	2853	"I'm a winner. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	23	2868	That's not being a poor sport or anything like that. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	24	2921	If somebody beats you up, you are not going to congratulate them (for) beating you up. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0002	25	3008	That doesn't make sense to me."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0003	1	182	US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said here Sunday the United States is pleased that Cuba has agreed to resume talks on migration issues and to start discussions on direct mail service. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0003	2	381	"We're very pleased that the Cuban government has agreed to talks on migration and direct mail links," Clinton told reporters after US officials announced the new discussions that continue a US-Cuban thaw in ties.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0005	0	58	Business says British politicians distracted by expenses row 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0005	1	192	The row over MPs' expenses is distracting Britain's politicians from confronting the serious economic issues facing the country, a prominent business leader said Monday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0005	2	371	Richard Lambert, director-general of the CBI, told the Financial Times that all the main parties should be focusing on their plans to deal with the recession ahead of European and local elections later this week. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0005	3	593	"I've just been talking to business people in Brussels and the sense of bewilderment about what's happening and what it means for the UK and Europe is palpable," Lambert told the FT. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0005	4	785	"We've got important elections and they are being completely overshadowed by these disclosures." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0005	5	891	He added: "Clearly there's an enormous, understandable public outrage... but we've got big decisions to be taken by all the big political parties about the future shape and role of the state, and these have been completely brushed to one side." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0005	6	1145	Polls over the weekend suggested British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Labour party is in danger of coming third in the elections for the European Parliament on Thursday, largely because of disillusionment over the expenses row. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0005	7	1383	The main opposition Conservatives have also suffered from the scandal and analysts expect fringe parties such as the anti-EU UK Independence Party (Ukip) and the far-right British National Party to benefit. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0005	8	1599	Brown insisted Sunday that he was focused on the recession, brushing aside calls for him to quit in favour of a more popular leader and saying: "I am dealing with the economy every day." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0005	9	1795	In an article in the Daily Mirror, he also launched a strong attack on the BNP, describing them as a "nasty extreme party" made up of "Nazi thugs" and urging voters not to back them when they go to the polls this week.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0007	1	210	Steve Stricker birdied the second playoff hole to win the 6.2 million-dollar Colonial on Sunday, leaving South African Tim Clark still in search of his first USPGA tour title. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0007	2	395	Stricker defeated Clark and Steve Marino in the playoff to claim his first title of 2009 to go with his runner-up, third-place, fourth-place, sixth- and seventh- place finishes this year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0007	3	592	For Clark it was yet another near miss. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0007	4	632	His 12.7 million dollars in US earnings are the most of any player without a victory in PGA Tour history. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0007	5	747	He squandered a two-shot lead with five holes left, including a bogey on the 72nd hole that forced the playoff. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0007	6	868	He also missed a putt that would have given him the victory at the first playoff hole. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0007	7	964	On the second, Stricker stuck his approach within a few feet and Clark almost followed suit. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0007	8	1066	But Clark's hit the stick and rolled more than 20 feet away. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0007	9	1127	The South African missed his birdie attempt and Stricker made his for a fifth career crown. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0007	10	1228	Clark, meanwhile, settled for a seventh second-place finish, including at this tournament behind Phil Mickelson last year.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0009	1	193	About 2,000 passengers were given the all-clear to leave the Pacific Dawn cruise ship here on Monday after Australian officials found none was carrying swine flu. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0009	2	365	The ship has been at the centre of an outcry after infected passengers were allowed to disembark last week, prompting an explosion in Australia's swine flu cases. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0009	3	537	"No evidence of any additional cases of human swine influenza has been found on board the Pacific Dawn, and most importantly, there has been no person-to-person transmission on board the ship," New South Wales' top health official, Kerry Chant, said in a statement.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0012	1	189	Britain's Prince Harry admitted Monday that he sometimes questions whether he will succeed in his army training -- but said his brother Prince William helps take the pressure off by cooking for him. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0012	2	397	The 24-year-old, the youngest son of Prince Charles and the late princess Diana, is currently training to be a pilot with the Army Air Corps. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0012	3	548	Based at RAF Shawbury in the West Midlands, he lives with William, who is training to become a search and rescue pilot with the Royal Air Force (RAF). 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0012	4	708	"We hardly ever see each other. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0012	5	740	And now we are living together and it's fantastic," Harry said in a syndicated interview. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0012	6	839	"(William) does most of the cooking. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0012	7	876	I spend time just lying around, watching TV and doing my work," he said, and joked: "The RAF don't have to work as hard as the army." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0012	8	1019	William is reportedly giving his brother advice ahead of his first helicopter flight in the coming weeks, and Harry admitted that he had found the training difficult. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0012	9	1195	"The flying courses are so intense," he said, adding: "It's surprised me." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0012	10	1279	He said: "There's times when I thought, you know, I'm really not cut out for this, mentally. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0012	11	1372	I hope I've got the physical skills to fly a helicopter. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0012	12	1438	"But mentally, there are the exams and everything. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0012	13	1489	I mean, I can't do maths, I gave that up when I left school, as anyone does at that age.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0013	1	182	Spanish construction magnate Florentino Perez will be sworn in as president of Real Madrid again later on Monday as no other candidate stood against him before the deadline, the club said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0013	2	380	The 62-year-old will be sworn in at the Real's Santiago Bernabeu stadium at 1 pm (1100 GMT), the club said in a statement posted on its website shortly after the deadline of midnight (2200 GMT) on Sunday had expired. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0013	3	606	Several challengers who had been expected to oppose him pulled out or were not able to lodge a bank guarantee of 57.4 million euros (81.1 million dollars) required by the club to be able to run for president. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0013	4	824	Perez last led Real, Spain's historically most successful team and the world's richest football club by revenues, from 2000 to 2006. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0013	5	966	Under his rein Real earned the nickname "Los Galacticos", winning the Primera Liga twice and the European Champions League with such stars as Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luis Figo and David Beckham. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0013	6	1172	He officially presented his candidacy on Thursday under the slogan "the dream is back" and said the team he would help build would be world beaters. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0013	7	1330	"We will build a spectacular team with top notch players. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0013	8	1388	We have set up a strong and stable sporting project which will be able to call upon footballers who will turn each Real Madrid match into a fascinating rendez-vous," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0013	9	1572	Perez has not mentioned any names regarding top signings but Spanish media has reported that Chilean Manuel Pellegrini, currently at Villarreal, would become coach in place of Juande Ramos and the club would also land AC Milan's Brazilian playmaker Kaka. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0013	10	1836	Media reports also constantly speculate that Cristiano Ronaldo, Liverpool's Spanish star Xabi Alonso and Bayern Munich's French star Franck Ribery will don the all-white strip next term.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0027	1	192	The head of last year's coup in Mauritania began a final push for votes Sunday in the week ahead of scheduled elections as his aides took part in talks about a possible delay to the polls. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0027	2	390	On a trip to the north, General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz pledged to improve living standards in the poverty-stricken nation if he returns to power after the scheduled June 6 ballot which he is widely expected to win. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0027	3	615	But with the main opposition boycotting next weekend's polls as little more than a sham, much of the attention was focused on neighbouring Senegal where international mediators are convening talks aimed at resolving the deadlock. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0027	4	854	According to the state news agency, Aziz pledged during a campaign appearance in the northern Atar region to work to bring about "an improvement in living standards for every citizen, in particular the most vulnerable".

AFP_ENG_20090531.0027	7	1368	Aziz denounced talk of a delay in the polls over the weekend as "rumours and lies", but the head of the main opposition party, Ahmed Ould Daddah, said that a deal "had existed". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0027	8	1555	"Its witnesses are numerous and credible, including representatives of the international community and Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade," Daddah said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0027	9	1718	"An unwritten agreement was reached 48 hours ago with the Ould Abdel Aziz camp, but we see since then a desire from that camp to backpedal on key points," said the leader of the Rally of Democratic Forces.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	0	58	New therapies to treat breast, lymph cancer: studies 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	1	194	New therapies developed following groundbreaking clinical trials appear to effectively target breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, according to research unveiled Sunday at a major cancer conference. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	2	407	The first therapy targeting the capacity of cancer cells to repair themselves shows promise in treating breast cancer, according to results of two small clinical trials. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	3	586	The new agent, especially adept at targeting cancers that are most difficult to cure, neutralizes an enzyme called PARP (poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase) and prevents it from playing its usual role in repairing the DNA of damaged cells. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	4	827	Like healthy cells, cancerous cells employ PARP to regenerate themselves after they have been damaged by chemo-therapy treatments. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	5	967	The studies examined whether breast cancers are more susceptible to chemotherapy when the PARP enzymes have been neutralized. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	6	1102	The first clinical trial was conducted with 116 women suffering from so-called triple negative breast cancer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	7	1221	These involve fast-spreading tumors that account for 15 percent of the 170,000 annual cases worldwide of breast cancer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	8	1350	Some of the cases were treated with chemotherapy and a PARP inhibitor called BSI-201 made by the firm BiPar Sciences, a US affiliate of the French-owned laboratory Sanofi-Aventis. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	9	1539	The rest of the group was treated only with chemotherapy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	10	1606	After six months, about 62 percent of the patients treated with BSI-201 combined with chemotherapy showed a comparative clinical improvement of 21 percent over the control group, said Joyce O'Shaughnessy, of the Baylor-Charles Sammons cancer center in Dallas, Texas. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	11	1882	She presented the results of the study at a conference of the American Society of Clinical Oncology this weekend in Orlando, Florida. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	12	2025	The women treated with BSI-201 survived 9.2 months on average, including 6.9 months in which the cancer did not spread, compared to an average survival of 6.9 months and 3.3 months in which the cancer was in check for those who were treated solely with chemotherapy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	13	2301	The second clinical study involved 54 women suffering from advanced breast cancer linked to the gene mutation BRCA1 or BRCA2. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	14	2427	They were treated with the PARP blocker Olaparib made by the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical AstraZenica. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	15	2530	There was no control group. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	16	2567	The test showed that 40 percent of the patients who took the drug experienced a reduction in their tumors, said Andrew Tutt, a cancer specialist at Kings College in London. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	17	2749	In another study presented here researchers examined a vaccine on patients over eight years that targeted follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a particularly aggressive form of lymphatic cancer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	18	2951	The study found that patients who received the BiovaxID vaccine experienced on average disease-free survival of approximately 44 months, compared to about 30 months for patients who received a control vaccine -- an increase of 47 percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	19	3199	The BiovaxID vaccine is patient-specific, in that each dose must be individually manufactured from tissue obtained from a patient's own cancerous tumor. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	20	3361	"With this vaccine, we've now moved into an era where we can safely use a patient's immune system to effectively fight follicular lymphoma and enhance the response to conventional chemotherapy" said lead study author Stephen Schuster. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0030	21	3605	"Because this vaccine uniquely recruits the patient's immune system to seek and destroy only tumor B-cells, this approach may be applicable to the treatment of other B-cell lymphomas," Schuster added.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0031	1	178	Nigeria's army said Sunday it had destroyed a rebel camp in southern Rivers state as part of its campaign to end years of violence and kidnappings in the oil-rich region. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0031	2	358	"The troops of Joint Task Force (JTF) have located and destroyed a militants' camp close to Buguma creek in Rivers State after a fierce exchange of fire with the militants," army spokesman Rabe Abubakar said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0031	3	576	"The troops of JTF were fired at from the militants' camp over night and the security outfit has no choice but to locate and destroy the camp," he said in an e-mail to AFP.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0031	5	897	Abubakar said the military also recovered some arms and ammunition during the raid. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0031	6	990	Several camps operated by militants have been destroyed since May 13 when federal troops launched their operation against fighters of the Movement for the Emancipation of Niger Delta (MEND), Nigeria's main militant group. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0031	7	1221	But MEND said in a statement late Sunday there was no fresh attack on its camp at Buguma. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0031	8	1320	"The leader of a small group of fighters around the Buguma creek axis in Rivers state, Egbele has confirmed that there was no attack in his camp as claimed by the military JTF," the group said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0031	9	1523	"He (Egbele) said they actually asked him to cooperate by giving the impression his camp has been over-run," MEND added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0031	10	1653	In the past three and a half years MEND, which says it is fighting to ensure local people have a greater share in the oil wealth, has been behind a series of kidnappings of staff and attacks on oil installations in the region.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0032	2	393	Abortion doctor George Tiller, was shot to death just after 10:00 am (1500 GMT) in the lobby of Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kansas, police and city officials said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0032	3	578	Wichita officials said the suspect, who was not identified, was arrested some three hours after the killing, and said they would have more details about the alleged shooter at a press conference planned for 4 pm local time (2100 GMT Sunday). 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0032	4	829	"It's an unfortunate incident to happen on a Sunday morning," Wichita police captain Brent Allred told reporters. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0032	5	952	"These things should not occur at a any time." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0032	6	1008	Long a lightning rod in the bitter US culture war over abortion, Tiller, 67, over the years had been picketed, bombed and shot in the arms, before being killed Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0032	7	1185	The shooting occurred just two weeks after President Barack Obama sought "common ground" over the divisive abortion debate in a controversial speech at one of the top Catholic universities in the United States. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0032	8	1405	The president has attempted to defuse one of the most emotive issues in US public life by arguing that while abortion should remain legal, the government should do all it can to limit unwanted pregnancies.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0032	16	2462	Some 2,000 protesters were also arrested outside the clinic during summer-long demonstrations in 1991. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0032	17	2574	He was acquitted in March on charges that he performed 19 illegal abortions in 2003 in a case which his lawyer described as a witch hunt. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0032	18	2721	Tiller testified during the trial that he spent years under the protection of federal agents after the FBI discovered an anti-abortion assassination list in 1994 that listed Tiller as the top target. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0032	19	2930	Tiller also testified that he owns one of only three clinics in the United States that perform late-term abortions, which are performed on fetuses that would be viable outside the mother's womb.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0034	8	1406	The president has attempted to defuse one of the most emotive issues in US public life by arguing that while abortion should remain legal, the government should do all it can to limit unwanted pregnancies. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0034	9	1621	But Obama has angered the anti-abortion movement by reversing predecessor George W.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0034	11	1866	Obama's choice for health secretary, former Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius, has been widely condemned by the anti-abortion movement because of her ties to Tiller. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0034	12	2041	Tiller, one of the few doctors who still performs late-term abortions in the United States, has been demonized by abortion opponents who regularly protested outside his clinic. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0034	13	2227	In 1986, someone placed a bomb on the roof of the clinic, seriously damaging the building. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0034	14	2327	In 1993, Tiller was shot in both arms outside the clinic. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0034	15	2385	Tiller recovered, and his assailant received an 11-year prison term. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0034	16	2463	Some 2,000 protesters were also arrested outside the clinic during summer-long demonstrations in 1991. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0034	17	2575	He was acquitted in March on charges that he performed 19 illegal abortions in 2003 in a case which his lawyer described as a witch hunt. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0034	18	2722	Tiller testified during the trial that he spent years under the protection of federal agents after the FBI discovered an anti-abortion assassination list in 1994 that listed Tiller as the top target. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0034	19	2931	Tiller also testified that he owns one of only three clinics in the United States that perform late-term abortions, which are performed on fetuses that would be viable outside the mother's womb. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0034	20	3135	Late-term abortions are legal in Kansas if two independent physicians agree that the mother could suffer irreparable harm by giving birth.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0035	1	177	Luis Cabral, the first post-independence president of Guinea-Bissau who was later toppled in a military coup, has died of a heart attack in Lisbon, officials announced on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0035	2	356	He was 78. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0035	3	376	"It is with shock and sadness that the government and people of Guinea-Bissau have learnt of the loss of one of their most illustrious sons, Luis Cabral," the government announced in a statement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0035	4	581	The government was to hold an emergency session to organise preparations for a three-day period of national mourning, the statement added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0035	5	729	Natural Resources Minister Oscar Barbosa, a close ally of the former president, said that Cabral had died of a heart attack in the Portuguese capital on Saturday night. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0035	6	907	Cabral was a half-brother of Amilcar Cabral, long-time leader of the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) liberation movement, who was assassinated in 1973 -- the year before Guinea-Bissau attained its independence from Portugal. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0035	7	1155	Cabral ruled in Guinea-Bissau until he was overthrown in a coup led by "First Commissar", or prime minister, Joao Bernardo Vieira on November 14, 1980. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0035	8	1316	After his ouster, Cabral was imprisoned for six months before being released after the intervention of the Cuban government. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0035	9	1450	He then spent most of the rest of his life in exile in Portugal, although he did make a brief return to Guinea-Bissau 1999 after Vieira was toppled in another coup. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0035	10	1624	News of his death comes less than three months after Vieira, who returned to power in 2005 elections, was assassinated by soldiers in the hours after a bomb attack which claimed the life of the West African country's military chief.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	1	194	British Prime Minister Gordon Brown insisted Sunday he would not quit despite a scandal over MPs expenses and dire poll ratings for his ruling Labour Party before crunch European and local elections. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	2	403	He said the expenses furore, which has shown how lawmakers claimed from the public purse for everything from moat cleaning to a duck island, was "appalling" and "offends everything that I believe in". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	3	613	Every member of parliament would be forced to account for all their expenses from the last four years, he promised. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	4	738	Some 13 lawmakers from Labour and the main opposition Conservatives have said they will resign since the Daily Telegraph newspaper began publishing the leaked claims three weeks ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	5	930	A new Sunday Telegraph/ICM poll suggested the revelations would hit Brown hard at the European and local elections, in which Britons vote Thursday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	6	1087	It suggested Labour would come third in the elections for the European Parliament with just 17 percent, behind David Cameron's Conservatives and the smaller centrist Liberal Democrats. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	7	1281	Even more damagingly, it suggested Labour would also come third in a general election with just 22 percent of the vote -- the worst Brown's party has done in an opinion poll since 1987. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	8	1476	Some 54 percent of those polled thought Labour had been worst affected by the expenses scandal, compared to 13 percent for the Conservatives. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	9	1627	But Brown, who must call a general election by the middle of next year, dismissed suggestions he could step down to make way for a more popular leader. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	10	1788	"Things go up and down," he said in an interview with BBC television. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	11	1858	"We're going through the most difficult economic circumstances the country has faced. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	12	1953	"People are angry rightly because they are worried when they see taxpayers' money wasted on their MPs and they're finding it very difficult... in a difficult economic situation," he added, referring to Britain's recession. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	13	2185	He also said he wanted to introduce a "constitutional renewal" bill and was looking at reforms including the case for a written constitution, lowering the voting age to 16 and reform of the unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	14	2429	Cameron, meanwhile, renewed his calls for a snap general election, telling the BBC the public wanted to "sit in judgement on MPs". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	15	2569	Public anger over expenses is widespread and in a sermon Sunday, the leader of the Scottish Catholic church expressed concern at the "fall from grace" of many people in politics, saying "money (was) at the root of many difficulties". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	16	2812	Cardinal Keith O'Brien called on "those in public service of whatever kind who have failed us to reclaim the high standards which we expect of them". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	17	2971	Turnout at European elections in Britain is usually low, due partly to widespread Eurosceptic sentiment, and in 2004 turnout was just 38 percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	18	3126	This time, fringe parties such as the anti-EU UK Independence Party and the far- right British National Party are expected to benefit. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	19	3261	Commentators say the BNP could even win its first seat at the European Parliament. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	20	3353	An Economist magazine/YouGov poll last week found that only 31 percent of Britons think its membership of the European Union is a good thing, compared to 37 percent who think it is bad. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0036	21	3548	ICM interviewed 1,013 adults by telephone May 27-28 for the Sunday Telegraph poll, while YouGov questioned 2,322 adults in Britain May 22-26.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0039	1	189	Real Betis were relegated from the Spanish top-flight on a heart-breaking final Sunday of the season, drawing 1-1 at home to Valladolid while relegation rivals Osasuna and Sporting Gijon both won. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0039	2	395	Betis started a point above the drop zone knowing a win would keep them in the top tier but Sporting's 2-1 comeback win over Recreativo Huelva coupled with Osasuna's sensational 2-1 victory against nine-man Real Madrid saw them relegated with 42 points. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0039	3	658	Betis, who are based in the southern city of Seville, were last relegated in 2000 but immediately won promotion the following season and have been in the first division since 2001, finishing as high as fourth in 2005.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0039	6	1081	Getafe, who drew 1-1 with Racing Santander, also finished on 42 points but stayed up on goal difference while Valladolid's draw at Betis was enough to keep them safe. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0039	7	1257	It was particularly tough for Betis duo Sergio Garcia and Ricardo Oliveira, who cost a combined 19 million euros after being relegated with Real Zaragoza last season.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0039	9	1577	Sporting had spent a decade in the second division before winning promotion last season and defied the odds to stay up with Luis Moran scoring a dramatic winner.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	0	58	Golf: Frenchman Cevaer shocks field to win European Open 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	1	188	France's Christian Cevaer, ranked a lowly 449th in the world, shocked a strong field to win the European Open here on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	2	323	After four rounds of golf that saw 45 changes of the lead, the 39-year-old Frenchman, who has failed to make the top-30 in his last 15 starts and whose only previous Tour victory was the 2004 Spanish Open, beat England's Steve Webster, Scot Gary Orr and Spaniard Alvaro Quiros by a shot. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	3	620	His winning total of 281, seven under par, was 13 strokes more than Ross Fisher took on the same London Club course last year - and his 74 was the highest last round by a winner all season. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	4	819	But while Webster and Quiros both became more victims of the 471-yard last when tied for the lead - both carved their drives into the crowd, with Quiros hitting spectators with his first and second shots - Cevaer kept his nerve. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	5	1057	During the week the par four played to an average of nearly 4.7, with 154 bogeys, 48 doubles and 26 sevens or worse, but Cevaer parred it the first two days, birdied it in the third round and finished with the par he needed. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	6	1291	"I'm not a long player, but I used my utility club and it worked out great," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	7	1386	"I made a point that no matter what happened just enjoy my golf, enjoy my skills and hang in there." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	8	1496	He played the front nine in 39 and did not have a birdie until the long 15th, but the problems meant that it brought him back into a share of top spot. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	9	1657	And then three closing pars were good enough to give him the 300,000 pounds first prize - easily the biggest of his 16-year professional career. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	10	1811	At 196th on the "Race to Dubai" money list entering the week he would have been delighted just to secure his card for next season, but now he has a five-year Tour exemption.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	12	2012	Overnight leader Jeev Milkha Singh of India was still at the top of the leaderboard in the European Open after windy conditions took a toll of scores at the London Club in Kent on Saturday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	13	2211	Singh shot a one under par 71 to leave him in the joint lead with France's Christian Cevaer who went one better with a round of 70. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	14	2352	But hot on their heels was 20-year-old rising star Rory McIlroy who caught the eye with a four-under-par 68 that saw the Northern Irishman close to within three shots of the leading duo after he'd been in 25th place overnight. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	15	2588	Alongside McIlroy in joint third place were England's Chris Wood and Spain's Alvaro Quiros. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	16	2689	Singh, the world number 39, defied the conditions to cover the final six holes in a superb four under par on a day where Spain's Sergio Garcia was one of several players to finish with a triple bogey seven. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	17	2905	Before his round Singh said it was vital for the progress of golf in India that it became an Olympic sport. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	18	3022	"Golf not being an Olympic sport we have not been getting any funding from the government," Singh said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	19	3135	"Hopefully in October it does and I think what happens after that is the government is going to allocate land in each and every city to have a public driving range so that a normal human being can go there and try a hand at it. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	20	3372	"That's when it's going to be really big in our country.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	24	3783	Everything is private. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	25	3815	"I remember there were a lot of good players when I was growing up who just didn't take it up - they just went back to the parents' business." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	26	3967	Last week McIlroy shot 65 at Wentworth before falling back in the final round and it appears injury may have been a factor, although it seems as if he is getting close to finding a cure. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0041	27	4163	McIlroy, who revealed he'd been struggling with a "little niggle" in his back, said: "I had a really nice bath last night, got into bed and watched the golf in the States.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	0	58	South Ossetia poll set to bolster rebel leader 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	1	191	The party backing South Ossetia's leader Eduard Kokoity was on course Sunday to sweep legislative elections and tighten the grip of the strongman president on the Georgian rebel region. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	2	386	Initial results showed Yedinstvo (Unity) well ahead in the vote in the mountainous rebel region that was the subject of a war last year between Moscow and Tbilisi and is recognised as independent by Russia and Nicaragua alone. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	3	622	The elections were marked by a sidelining of the local opposition who accuse Kokoity of seeking a loyal parliamentary majority to push through an amendment allowing him to run again for office when his second term lapses in 2011. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	4	861	Based on an initial count of almost 61 percent of the vote, South Ossetia's central election commission said Unity had polled 48.04 percent while the People's Party, also largely uncritical of Kokoity, won 18.47 percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	5	1091	The Communists were second with 23.51 percent of the vote. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	6	1159	Final results were due at 0600 GMT on Monday with officials estimating the turnout at 80 percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	7	1266	Only four parties are competing for the 34 seats in the parliament and the central election commission barred the only two parties not loyal to Kokoity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	8	1428	The name of Unity also bears more than a passing resemblance to Russia's ruling party Edinaya Rossiya (United Russia) and it even used pictures of United Russia party leader Boris Gryzlov on its campaign literature. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	9	1653	But Russia -- which outraged the West by recognising South Ossetia as independent in the wake of the August war with Georgia -- has said South Ossetia should not amend the existing term limits in its constitution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	10	1876	Kokoity said it was too early to say whether he planned to run again to lead the region of 50,000 people although he did not rule out that possibility. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	11	2037	"There are two and half years left till then and a lot left to do. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	12	2104	We are working and working now. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	13	2136	I am not thinking about it yet," he said in an interview with AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	14	2212	"With what happened in August we need three to four years to rebuild," Kokoity said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	15	2306	Opposition activities said voting would not make a difference. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	16	2369	"I plan to sit at home. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	17	2393	There's nothing we can do," said Alan Gassiyev, an opposition leader, calling the polls "completely illegal." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	18	2512	Critics accuse Kokoity, an ex-wrestling champion, of muzzling opponents and stealing the money sent from Russia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	19	2634	As the reconstruction in the province stalled this winter, the opposition also accuses the separatist leader and his circle of diverting lorries carrying construction material and humanitarian aid to traffic the goods in Russia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	20	2872	But despite the slow pace of reconstruction in the republic many praise Kokoity for his leadership during the August conflict. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	21	3008	"Kokoity has done a lot for the people of South Ossetia, he's fought 20 years for this country," Angela Tedeyeva, a 32-year-old teacher, said as she cast her ballot. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	22	3183	Georgia ridiculed the vote, with the country's reintegration minister Temur Iakobashvili saying the elections were "nothing but clownery, a farce and a redistribution of a criminal power." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	23	3381	But Kokoity insisted the elections were in strict accordance with law, saying the polls were "a maturity test for the small independent state." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	24	3534	His domestic critics are concerned that the high number of polling stations  in the villages which were used to be populated by ethnic Georgians and which are now nearly empty will be used to falsify the election results. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	25	3765	As the row over Kokoity's push for a third term threatens to become an embarrassment for Moscow, there are signs the Kremlin is scaling back its support for the South Ossetian leader. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	26	3958	Sergey Naryshkin, the head of the Russian presidential administration, said on Russian television this month that South Ossetia should not change the existing term limits in its constitution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0042	27	4159	Moscow and Tbilisi fought a brief but intense war last August over the region, which had enjoyed de facto independence since the early 1990s thanks to tacit Russian support.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0043	1	207	A party strongly supportive of the leader of Georgia's breakaway region of South Ossetia was well ahead in parliamentary elections Sunday, initial results showed. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0043	2	379	The apparent dominance of Yedinstvo (Unity) in the legislative elections should allow president Eduard Kokoity to cement his grip on the mountainous rebel region recognised as independent by Russia and Nicaragua alone. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0043	3	607	Based on an initial count of almost 61 percent of the vote, South Ossetia's central election commission said Unity had polled 48.04 percent while the People's Party, also largely uncritical of Kokoity, won 18.47 percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0043	4	837	The Communists were second with 23.51 percent of the vote.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	1	189	The US Treasury Department on Sunday put final touches on a plan to restructure General Motors, once the world's largest automaker and now expected to join rival Chrysler in filing for bankruptcy protection. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	2	406	Monday will be a historic day for the US automobile industry, with  President Barack Obama poised to discuss General Motors' bankruptcy in remarks planned for 11:30 am (1530 GMT) Monday, after auto giant officially files its bankruptcy paperwork, US media reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	3	681	Meanwhile, GM's new chief executive, Fritz Henderson, has scheduled a news conference for the middle of the day in New York, where the number one US automaker would file for bankruptcy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	4	876	The US administration had given GM until June 1 to present a viable restructuring plan, in return for government aid, and the US Treasury Department had given holders of General Motors until the end of the day Saturday to respond to the rescue plan. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	5	1135	The plan was approved by holders of about 54 percent of the company's bond debt according to Elliot Sloane, spokesman for an ad hoc bondholders committee. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	6	1290	Washington had warned that if the plan were rejected, creditors risked losing everything. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	7	1389	Agreement boosted the Treasury's plan for creating a new company shorn of labor costs and money losing assets, in a rescue that could reach 60 billion dollars as the state takes a 72.5 per cent ownership stake in the 101 year old company. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	8	1637	Canada, which has several GM factories, is also set to be digging into its pockets for the rescue plan. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	9	1750	Among the backers was a committee of large investors holding about 20 percent of GM's 27.2 billion dollars in outstanding bonds, The New York Times reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	10	1917	Under the plan, the bondholders would obtain the rights to buy an extra 15 percent of GM's stock at a low price. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	11	2030	They would also control 25 percent of the new GM, after having supported the new company's creation in bankruptcy court. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	12	2160	Bondholders who rejected the plan could still fight it in court, but the government maintains they could end up with little or nothing if they take that path. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	13	2328	Meanwhile Monday New York bankruptcy judge Arthur Gonzales was set to rule on number three US automaker Chrysler, which filed for bankruptcy protection a month ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	14	2502	Under an expedited process, Gonzales was expected to approve the creation of a new Chrysler that would preserve the automaker's healthiest assets and liquidate the rest. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	15	2681	The new entity will be controlled by a consortium consisting of the Italian automaker Fiat, the United Auto Workers union, and the US and Canadian governments. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	16	2850	Fiat will have a 20 percent stake with the option to increase it to 35 percent; the UAW 55 percent; and the US and Canadian governments 10 percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	17	3007	The automakers' fate, the subject of debate on television talks shows, is being closely watched in US political and economic circles.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	24	3467	At the end of last year, GM had 244,000 employees around the world, about half of them in the United States. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	25	3585	Republican Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, called the auto rescue plan "a big mistake," arguing that the government had done too much to keep GM and Chyrsler out of bankruptcy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	26	3784	In an interview with CNN, he held up the example of Ford, the number two US automaker, as "an American company that hasn't taken government money and is still producing automobiles." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	27	3976	Corporate leaders, meanwhile, urged the government not to overstay its welcome in the private sector. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	28	4087	"I think all of us understand the need for the government to intervene and take the actions they did," said Anne Mulcahy, chief executive of Xerox. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	29	4235	"But I also think there's a need for an exit plan." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	30	4296	The possibility of bankruptcy for such an iconic American company has been viewed with great foreboding in a country where the automobile is deeply embedded in the national imagination. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0049	31	4491	"The phrase 'bankrupt General Motors,' which we expect to hear uttered on Monay, leaves Americans my age in economic shock," the writer PJ O'Rourke said in the Wall Street Journal.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0050	1	185	Sicily's city of Palermo was buried in a mountain of waste on Sunday as garbage collectors pressed on with a strike over fears that their struggling employer will not pay them. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0050	2	371	Piles of trash as high as two metres (6 feet 5 inches) lined apartment buildings and church walls across the city, as firefighters received reports of some 200 rubbish fires sparked by hot temperatures on the island. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0050	3	597	Garbagemen have been on strike or have done limited trash pick-ups as they refuse to work overtime for fear of not getting paid by their employer, the trash collection company Amia, which is 150 million euros in the hole. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0050	4	828	The city council dropped Sunday a plan to raise the waste management tax by 30 percent to help Amia after a stormy municipal meeting. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0050	5	971	Mayor Diego Cammarata said the strike was "seriously irresponsible" as the city was more and more "invaded by trash in an intolerable and indecent way." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0050	6	1133	The collectors' union decided to remain on strike until they received guarantees on the future of their employer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0050	7	1256	They also demanded better work equipment, saying that they were not working in safe conditions. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0050	8	1361	The strike recalls the rubbish problems that have hit Naples, where the mafia has been blamed for a garbage crisis in a city that has been on a "waste state of emergency" for 14 years.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0051	1	197	Organisers of the Volvo Ocean Race announced Sunday changes to the next edition of the round-the-world yacht race aimed at boosting the number of women who take part. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0051	2	373	For the first time in the 36-year history of the event, formerly called the Whitbread race, no women sailors are taking part in the 2008-09 edition of the race, which involves eight teams and began in Alicante, Spain in October. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0051	3	611	Organisers decided that female teams will be allowed to carry 12 sailors, two of whom may be men, instead of just 10 for an all male team during the next edition of the world's most grueling offshore yacht race scheduled for 2011-12. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0051	4	854	The change in the rules for the crew make-up for the next race was "an effort to encourage female participation", they said in a statement following a meeting in Galway, Ireland where current race entries have made a stop. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0051	5	1086	Specialists say female entries have disappeared from the race due to the selection of the more powerful Volvo Open 70 yachts in 2004, which are longer and require more physical force to control than the old Ocean 60 yachts that were used before.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	16	2312	She moved into a private nursing home in Hampshire after breaking her hip three years ago, and after struggling to pay the bills was forced to sell off some of her memorabilia.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0052	18	2729	Dean was also forced to sell a 100-year-old suitcase filled with clothes donated to her family by the people of New York when they arrived after being rescued.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0055	9	1632	The SDP got four county prefects and secured control of five county assemblies. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0055	10	1721	Local analysts said the vote confirmed that the SDP and left bloc dominate in more developed parts of Croatia as well as in cities, while the HDZ and right- wing parties are more popular in less developed and rural areas.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0058	3	563	The president's administration had given GM until June 1 to present a viable restructuring plan, in return for government aid, and the US Treasury Department had given holders of General Motors until the end of the day Saturday to respond to the plan.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0058	14	2115	Bondholders who rejected the plan could still fight it in bankruptcy court, but the government has warned they could end up with little or nothing if they take that path.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0060	1	176	The month of May witnessed 155 deaths from violence in Iraq, the fewest of any month since the US-led invasion in 2003, official figures showed on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0060	2	340	Statistics compiled by the defence, interior and health ministries showed that 124 civilians, six soldiers and 25 policemen were killed by attacks in May. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0060	3	504	People wounded included 285 civilians, four soldiers and 55 police. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0060	4	581	Some 40 presumed insurgents were killed and 904 arrested, according to the statistics. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0060	5	677	Deaths from violence fell by more than half from the 355 registered in April, which was the deadliest month since September last year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0060	6	821	However, 24 US soldiers died in Iraq in May, up from 19 in April and the heaviest toll since September. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0060	7	934	According to an AFP count based on the independent website icasualties.org, 4,306 American troops have been killed in Iraq since the 2003 invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein but sparked a deadly insurgency.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0062	2	373	Boom, who rides for the Rabobank team, took over the race leader's black jersey in the penultimate stage in Fleron on Saturday and finished second in the time- trial, six seconds behind Rosseler of Quick Step.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0062	6	932	"I wasn't sure of anything because I've not raced much on the road since the start of the season, not more than eight or nine days." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	0	58	South Ossetia poll set to bolster rebel leader 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	1	191	The party backing South Ossetia's leader Eduard Kokoity was on course Sunday to sweep legislative elections and tighten the grip of the strongman president on the Georgian rebel region. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	2	386	Initial results showed Yedinstvo (Unity) well ahead in the vote in the mountainous rebel region that was the subject of a war last year between Moscow and Tbilisi and is recognized as independent by Russia and Nicaragua alone. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	3	622	The elections were marked by a sidelining of the local opposition who accuse Kokoity of seeking a loyal parliamentary majority to push through an amendment allowing him to run again for office when his second term lapses in 2011. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	4	861	Based on an initial count of almost eight percent of the vote, South Ossetia's central election commission said Unity had polled 58.62 percent while the People's Party, also largely uncritical of Kokoity, won 20.35 percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	5	1094	The Communists were third with 14.6 percent of the vote. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	6	1151	Final results were due at 0600 GMT on Monday with officials estimating the turnout at 80 percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	7	1258	Only four parties are competing for the 34 seats in the parliament and the central election commission barred the only two parties not loyal to Kokoity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	8	1420	The name of Unity also bears more that a passing resemblance to Russia's ruling party Edinaya Rossiya (United Russia) and it even used pictures of United Russia party leader Boris Gryzlov on its campaign literature. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	9	1645	But Russia -- which outraged the West by recognising South Ossetia as independent in the wake of the August war with Georgia -- has said South Ossetia should not amend the existing term limits in its constitution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	10	1868	Kokoity said it was too early to say whether he planned to run again to lead the region of 50,000 people although he did not rule out that possibility. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	11	2029	"There are two and half years left till then and a lot left to do. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	12	2096	We are working and working now. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	13	2128	I am not thinking about it yet," he said in an interview with AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	14	2204	"With what happened in August we need three to four years to rebuild," Kokoity said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	15	2298	Opposition activities said voting would not make a difference. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	16	2361	"I plan to sit at home. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	17	2385	There's nothing we can do," said Alan Gassiyev, an opposition leader, calling the polls "completely illegal." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	18	2504	Critics accuse Kokoity, an ex-wrestling champion, of muzzling opponents and stealing the money sent from Russia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	19	2626	As the reconstruction in the province stalled this winter, the opposition also accuses the separatist leader and his circle of diverting lorries carrying construction material and humanitarian aid to traffic the goods in Russia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	20	2864	But despite the slow pace of reconstruction in the republic many praise Kokoity for his leadership during the August conflict. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	21	3000	"Kokoity has done a lot for the people of South Ossetia, he's fought 20 years for this country," Angela Tedeyeva, a 32-year-old teacher, said as she cast her ballot. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	22	3175	Georgia ridiculed the vote, with the country's reintegration minister Temur Iakobashvili saying the elections were "nothing but clownery, a farce and a redistribution of a criminal power." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	23	3373	But Kokoity insisted the elections were in strict accordance with law, saying the polls were "a maturity test for the small independent state." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	24	3526	His domestic critics are concerned that the high number of polling stations  in the villages which were used to be populated by ethnic Georgians and which are now nearly empty will be used to falsify the election results. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	25	3757	As the row over Kokoity's push for a third term threatens to become an embarrassment for Moscow, there are signs the Kremlin is scaling back its support for the South Ossetian leader. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	26	3950	Sergey Naryshkin, the head of the Russian presidential administration, said on Russian television this month that South Ossetia should not change the existing term limits in its constitution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0063	27	4151	Moscow and Tbilisi fought a brief but intense war last August over the region, which had enjoyed de facto independence since the early 1990s thanks to tacit Russian support. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	0	58	Israel's Barak visits US in bid to heal rift 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	1	179	Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak will try to heal a growing rift with his country's main ally over the Middle East peace process when he starts talks with top officials in the United States on Monday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	2	392	Barak is likely to devote a lot of time to easing tensions, although the talks were originally planned to focus mainly on bilateral defence ties and US-led international efforts to halt Iran's nuclear drive, an aide said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	3	623	During the three-day trip, he is expected to meet Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of Defence Robert Gates, National Security Adviser James Jones and President Barack Obama's special envoy to the Middle East, George Mitchell. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	4	861	The defence chief is also expected to discuss US arms sales to Israel, including a request for it to buy up to 75 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters in a deal worth as much as 15.2 billion dollars and other advanced weapon systems, a senior official said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	5	1118	Barak's visit comes just two weeks after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held his first meeting with Obama in Washington, revealing deep divisions over ways to move forwards towards Middle East peace. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	6	1330	The hawkish premier sparked international criticism over his repeated refusal to endorse the creation of a Palestinian state, a bedrock principle of international peacemaking efforts over the past two decades. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	7	1549	Tensions have intensified, with Israel rejecting repeated US calls to halt all settlement activity in the occupied West Bank, the major part of the proposed Palestinian state. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	8	1734	Barak, a former prime minister and head of the centre-left Labour party, aims to use his personal ties to avert a crisis between Washington and Netanyahu's right-leaning government, a senior official told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	9	1953	But it remains unclear whether Barak will be able to ease the tensions as he himself has said that Israel must maintain its right to continue building within the boundaries of large settlement blocs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	10	2162	"It seems that the prime minister made Israel's positions and needs clear to the US administration. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	11	2262	The dialogue will take time and it will have many ups and downs," the Labour leader has told reporters. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	12	2375	One official said Barak will propose that within a short time Israel would dismantle dozens of illegal outposts in the West Bank if the United States lets Israel go on building inside existing settlements to meet "natural growth." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	13	2615	A senior Israeli official complained that Obama -- who has vowed to pursue Middle East peace talks as part of a changed approach to the region -- is placing unfair demands on the Jewish state. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	14	2817	"The Americans have demanded almost nothing from the Palestinians but are asking Israel to take steps that are a real sacrifice. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	15	2946	These demands are unfair," he told AFP on condition of anonymity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	16	3021	Despite discord over the Middle East peace talks, Obama eased Israeli concerns over his efforts to persuade Iran to halt its nuclear programme in direct negotiations, with the president saying the success of the dialogue would be assessed by the year's end. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	17	3288	"This dialogue ought to be short and should have milestones to check whether it is serious or not," Barak said recently. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	18	3409	"I believe the chances that talks will halt Iran's nuclear programme are very low." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	19	3502	The former chief of staff reiterated that Israel would not rule out military action against nuclear sites in the Islamic republic. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	20	3642	"Israel believes that no option should be removed from the table," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0064	21	3727	Israel, widely considered to be the Middle East's sole if undeclared nuclear armed power, suspects Iran is using its nuclear programme to develop atomic weapons, a charge Tehran has long denied. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	0	58	Troops hunt Taliban as Pakistan says victory near 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	1	193	Pakistan's defence secretary said Sunday that a month-long offensive to crush Taliban fighters in northwest Swat could end within days, as fierce fighting spilled into a nearby tribal area. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	2	392	Swat valley's main town Mingora is back in government hands, the military announced late Saturday, and security officials said they were now pursuing the top leadership of the hardline Taliban movement into the nearby mountains. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	3	630	Secretary of Defence Syed Athar Ali told a security forum in Singapore that three targeted northwest districts were almost clear of Taliban rebels. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	4	787	"Operations in Swat, Buner and adjoining areas have almost met complete success," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	5	887	"Only five to ten percent of the job is remaining and hopefully within the next two to three days these pockets of resistance will be cleared." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	6	1040	However, chief military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas told AFP that it was impossible to estimate when the offensive would end. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	7	1183	"The operation is continuing in all of the areas and at this stage we cannot give any timeframe," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	8	1299	The army remains locked in battle in some areas, but the fall of Mingora was a critical milestone in an offensive launched after the Taliban thrust to within 100 kilometres (60 miles) of Islamabad in April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	9	1515	Pakistan's military also reported that 25 militants and seven soldiers were killed in clashes in South Waziristan near the Afghan border, a bolt-hole for Taliban and Al-Qaeda-linked militants south of the current army bombardment. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	10	1755	"Miscreants attacked a security forces checkpost last night (Saturday) in Spinkai Raghzai, South Waziristan agency. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	11	1871	The attack was repulsed successfully, inflicting heavy casualties on militants," it said in a statement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	12	1985	Fifteen militants and three soldiers died in the clash in Spinkai Raghzai, while elsewhere in the semi-autonomous tribal area 10 insurgents and four troops including a lieutenant died when rebels attacked a military convoy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	13	2218	Civilians have started fleeing the area fearing a fresh military onslaught, but the army has denied an imminent assault on Waziristan, where militants branded by Washington as the greatest terror threat to the West are holed up. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	14	2456	The United States, which is firmly backing the current military drive, had warned that the rebels threaten Pakistan's very existence. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	15	2599	Officials have said that lower-ranking Taliban leaders had been killed but it was harder to get to the top leaders, who had a network of hardcore militants around them and had slipped into the rugged mountain terrain. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	16	2826	"They will be eliminated wherever we find them," said one military official, who did not wish to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media, adding: "We believe that they are somewhere in the mountains." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	17	3052	Pakistan has slapped a 600,000-dollar price on the head of firebrand Swat Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah for masterminding the nearly two-year uprising in the valley to enforce sharia law. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	18	3255	The government has also offered rewards for 21 rebel chiefs -- wanted dead or alive -- from Swat. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	19	3353	The military claims to have killed 1,244 militants since the offensive began, although the numbers are impossible to verify. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	20	3487	As the government ups its campaign to stamp out the militants, fears are growing of a wave of revenge attacks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	21	3607	The northwestern capital Peshawar and the eastern cultural centre of Lahore have both been rocked by deadly explosions in the last five days, killing a total of 39 people and wounding hundreds more. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	22	3815	A spokesman for Pakistan Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud has claimed Wednesday's suicide bombing on a police building in Lahore, and warned of more "massive attacks" to avenge the Swat military operation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	23	4028	Nearly 2.4 million people have fled the current offensive, and the military relaxed a curfew Sunday in most parts of the northwest including Mingora to allow people trapped on the roads to return home or leave the region. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	24	4259	Senior Red Cross officials said Sunday they were "gravely concerned" over the situation in Swat Valley, after an ICRC team reported problems with running water, food, electricty and communications. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	25	4466	"The people of Swat need greater humanitarian protection and assistance immediately," said Pascal Cuttat, head of the organisation's delegation in Pakistan. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0065	26	4632	"Given what we have already seen on the ground, we are mobilising additional resources, but safe and unimpeded access to the area remains essential for our teams to deliver."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0067	1	181	The final report on staging provincial elections in Iraq's disputed region of Kirkuk has been delayed by another week because of disagreements among commission members, an MP said on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0067	2	381	"The commission on Sunday notified parliament speaker Iyad al-Samarrai that it had not succeeded in reaching a compromise" acceptable to Kirkuk's Kurdish, Turkmen and Arab communities, Mohammad Mahdi al-Bayati, a Turkmen member of the commission, told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0067	3	647	Samarrai asked commission members "to continue their mission another week" and said he will submit "his own suggestions for a solution," Bayati added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0067	4	807	Arabs and Turkmen oppose to any further extension beyond a week although the Kurds have no objection, he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0067	5	927	The commission should have delivered its report on elections in the province by mid-April, but the deadline was put back to the end of May. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0067	6	1076	Oil-rich Kirkuk, 250 kilometres (150 miles) north of the capital, has a population of around 900,000. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0067	7	1187	The Arab and Turkmen communities want seats on the provincial council to be divided into three equal blocs, but the Kurds say they form the majority of the population and want better representation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0067	8	1395	Intercommunal tensions prevented the staging of provincial elections in Kirkuk on January 31, when the rest of Iraq except the three Kurdish provinces voted for new councils. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0067	9	1579	The national parliament in Baghdad, backed by the United Nations, set up a commission to look for a solution.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0068	1	167	French club Albi have rebounded into the Top 14 after a 14-12 second-division play-off victory over Oyonnax on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0068	2	295	Albi were demoted by the country's rugby federation to the second division last season because of financial irregularities. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0068	3	428	But with their shop now in order, the club battled back to seal the second promotion spot after Paris-based Metro Racing claimed the second division title to win automatic promotion. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0069	0	58	Bulgarians protest at Polish mother in tug-of-love saga 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0069	1	186	Hundreds of Bulgarians protested Sunday outside the Polish embassy in Sofia to voice their fury over a tug-of-love saga which saw an eight-year-old girl taken back into the custody of her mother. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0069	2	391	The crowd, numbering more than a thousand, denounced both Barbara Jadwigd, the Polish mother of Nikoleta Vasilev, and embassy officials who helped her retrieve the eight-year-old from her father's home in line with a court order. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0069	3	630	Emotions have been running high since a report on the private Nova channel last week showed how Jadwigd had dragged her sobbing daughter into an embassy car outside her father's home in the southeastern Bulgarian town of Asenovgrad. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0069	4	872	As Nikoleta screamed for help from her father and grandmother, her seven-year- old brother Pavel managed to escape and is still missing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0069	5	1018	Jadwigd had obtained custody rights in a court case after accusing the father, Todor Vasilev, of kidnapping them from their home in Poland. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0069	6	1167	The father denied having taken the children to Bulgaria against their will, and accused Jadwigd of being a poor parent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0069	7	1296	Many Bulgarian politicians, including European Affairs Minister Gergana Passi, have denounced the mother's behaviour while recognising the fact that a court had indeed granted her the right to take them from the father. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0069	8	1525	The Polish embassy in Sofia meanwhile published a statement on its website saying that it "regrets the fact that some media reports on this case are far from objective ... and cause unnecessary emotions in the society that do not contribute to solving the case." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0069	9	1797	"The Bulgarian court ruled at two instances that the children must be returned to the place from which they were kidnapped, against the will and in the absence of one of the parents," it added.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0079	1	191	Manuel Jose ended his title-strewn career as Al-Ahly coach disastrously when the Egyptian giants were dumped out of the African Confederation Cup by Santos in Angola on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0079	2	377	Ahly, winners of the African Champions League a record six times, took a 3-0 lead into the return match and even the absence of star midfielder Mohamed Aboutraika was not expected to prevent them reaching the group phase. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0079	3	608	But a Santos team competing in Africa for the first time this year had other ideas and triumphed 3-0 in Luanda to level the aggregate score before winning the fourth-round tie 6-5 on penalties.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0079	5	900	My players have won so many trophies with me," a stunned Jose told AFP at Coqueiros Stadium in the Angolan capital. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0079	6	1025	"But, at the same time, the team was tired as we have just finished the Egyptian championship and we also had three players missing on national duty in Oman.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0079	8	1276	I love and respect the club so much and it was the best time in my life as a coach." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0079	9	1370	Among those who failed from the spot for Ahly was Angola-born striker Flavio Amado, whose agent claims he is quitting the Cairo 'Red Devils' for a three-year contract with Saudi Arabian outfit Al-Shabab.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0079	13	2217	Success for Santos completed a wonderful weekend for the oil-rich southern Africa nation in the second-tier African club competition, as Primeiro Agosto eliminated holders CS Sfaxien in Tunisia on Saturday, also after a shootout. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0079	14	2456	Ahly have campaigned in Africa regularly since 1975 and this was only the fourth time they had suffered a three-goal loss, with Mouloudia Alger of Algeria, Hearts of Oak of Ghana and Al-Hilal of Sudan inflicting the other defeats. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0079	15	2696	The heavy reverses against Mouloudia and Hearts came three decades ago while Hilal triumphed two years ago in Omdurman against a club that claims 40 million supporters in Egypt and the Middle East. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0079	16	2903	It was a sad exit for Jose, who stays in Luanda to take over a struggling Angolan national team from June 1 with the task of building a team capable of using home advantage to win the 2010 African Nations Cup. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0079	17	3122	The 63-year-old Portuguese led Ahly to four of their six African Champions League titles and many African media observers consider him the greatest foreign coach to have worked at club level on the continent.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0081	1	185	Barcelona striker Thierry Henry has been ruled out of France's forthcoming friendly matches against Nigeria and Turkey due to a knee injury, France coach Raymond Domenech revealed on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0081	2	385	France have not yet decided to call up any replacements for the home games against Nigeria on June 2 and Turkey three days later. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0081	3	524	Henry, 31, played in Barcelona's 2-0 victory over Manchester United in the Champions League final in Rome on Wednesday, having overcome a knee ligament injury sustained in the Spanish champions' 6-2 thrashing of Real Madrid on May 2. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0081	4	767	"I expected it a little bit," Domenech said on the French Football Federation website on Sunday.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0105	1	186	Dethroned French Open champion Rafael Nadal vowed to bounce back from his stunning loss to Robin Soderling, which shattered his dreams of a record fifth successive Roland Garros title. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0105	2	380	The world number one insisted he'd be better and stronger in time for his Wimbledon title defence in three weeks' time. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0105	3	509	"It's the end of the road and I have to accept it," said the world number one, who was beaten for the first time at Roland Garros following 31 wins in 31 matches since his 2005 debut which propelled him to super-stardom. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0105	4	739	"I have to accept my defeat as I accept my victories - with calm. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0105	5	805	I have to keep a cool head to try and analyze what I did wrong.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0105	10	1154	For Nadal, losing his proud record could not have come at the hands of the worst possible opponent after he and Soderling, who are not on speaking terms, fell out after an acrimonious Wimbledon defeat in 2007. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0105	11	1373	Nadal was irritated by the big Swede's on-court imitation of his habit of pulling at the rear of his shorts while Soderling dismissed the criticisms as "bullshit". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0105	12	1546	Nadal, who turns 23 on Wednesday, said he would not get too downcast about his fourth round 6-2, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) defeat. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0105	13	1686	The first thing he will do is head to the swimming pool at his Mallorca home and convince himself that one defeat has not suddenly made him a bad player following a 12 months where he won Wimbledon, the Olympics and the Australian Open. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0105	14	1932	"This is sport, and you can have victories or defeats.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0105	21	2484	He's the best claycourt player of all time, but he's just like someone else to me," said the Swede who goes on to tackle two-time semi-finalist Nikolay Davydenko for a place in the last four. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0105	22	2685	Soderling believes that the time he spent out of action at the end of 2007 and the start of 2008, nursing a wrist injury, may have proved a crucial part in his victory on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0105	23	2873	"I was a little bit lucky because it was my left wrist. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0105	24	2929	I was off the tour for maybe five or six months, but I practiced a lot of tennis," he explained. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0105	25	3035	"I practiced my slice and my forehand.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0105	27	3132	I used the time very well.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0105	29	3243	I was working out three, four hours in the gym every day." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0105	30	3311	Soderling also paid tribute to compatriot and coach Magnus Norman who made the 2000 final here. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0105	31	3416	"He definitely helped me a lot. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0105	32	3448	He was a great player. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0105	33	3471	What I like is that I can really ask him anything - 'Did you feel the same when you were playing?'

AFP_ENG_20090531.0110	1	191	Manuel Jose ended his title-strewn career as Al-Ahly coach disastrously when the Egyptian giants were dumped out of the African Confederation Cup by Santos in Angola on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0110	2	377	Ahly, winners of the African Champions League a record six times, took a 3-0 lead into the return match and even the absence of star midfielder Mohamed Aboutraika was not expected to prevent them reaching the group phase. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0110	3	608	But a Santos team competing in Africa for the first time this year had other ideas and triumphed 3-0 in Luanda to level the aggregate score before winning the fourth-round tie 6-5 on penalties.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	13	1925	Just two minutes later former Arsenal star Mathieu Flamini grazed the bar with a vicious shot from 22 yards as Milan demonstrated their potency. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	14	2079	Fiorentina had a good shout for a penalty on 42 minutes when Giuseppe Favalli appeared to haul down Gilardino but the referee gave a foul the other way. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0125	15	2241	On 48 minutes the striker went close again as he curled a shot just past the post with the outside of his right boot.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	0	58	French physicists claim breakthrough in ultra-fast data access 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	1	193	French physicists said on Sunday they had used ultra-fast lasers that could accelerate storage and retrieval of data on hard discs by up to 100,000 times, pointing the way to a new generation of IT wizardry. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	2	410	The research builds on achievements that earned the 2007 Nobel physics prize for Albert Fert of France and Peter Gruenberg of Germany, who ushered in a revolution in miniaturised storage in the 1990s. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	3	620	Fert and Gruenberg discovered that tiny changes in magnetic fields can yield a large electric output. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	4	731	These differences in turn cause changes in the current in the readout head that scans a hard disk to spot the ones and zeroes in which data is stored. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	5	891	That discovery opened the way to "spintronics", a form of electronics that uses not only electrical charge but also the spin of electrons in individual atoms to provide a more compact, denser storage on hard drives. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	6	1116	But reading and writing data through spintronics has been hampered by the relative slowness of magnetic sensors. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	7	1238	In a study published in the specialist journal Nature Physics, a team led by Jean-Yves Bigot of the Institute of Materials Physics and Chemistry in Strasbourg employed a "femtosecond" laser, using ultra-fast bursts of laser light, to alter electron spin and thus speed up retrieval and storage. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	8	1542	"Our method is called the photonics of spin, because it is photons [particles of light] that modify the state of the electrons' magnetisation" on the storage surface, Bigot told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	9	1734	Data is retrieved with a burst that lasts just a millionth of a billionth of a second, said Bigot. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	10	1842	Femtosecond lasers currently measure around 30 centimetres (12 inches) by 10 centimetres (four inches) which means they are too big for consumer electronics, he cautioned. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	11	2023	Bigot added, though, that their miniaturisation is likely to be achieved over the next decade. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0126	12	2127	IBM, Hitachi and other corporations are "extremely interested" by the research, Bigot said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	0	58	First genes spotted for testicular cancer 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	1	172	Scientists in Britain said Sunday they had found the first genes that are associated with testicular cancer, the commonest form of cancer for men between the ages of 15 and 45. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	2	358	Telltale variants in chromosomes 5, 6 and 12 are linked with an increased risk of the disease, according to their study, which compared the genetic code of 730 men who had testicular cancer with that of healthy men. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	3	583	Inheriting the basket of three factors boosts the risk of the cancer, called testicular gem cell tumour, by up to fourfold. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	4	716	The study is published online in the journal Nature Genetics. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	5	787	"We have known for some time that men whose father, brothers or sons had testicular cancer are much more likely to get it themselves and we have been searching for this genetic link," said one of the investigators, Elizabeth Rapley of the Institute of Cancer Research, in the southern English county of Surrey. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	6	1107	"We believe there are more (risk factors) still to be found and we are working on identifying the rest." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	7	1221	The three telltales lie near genes that nurture testicular cells which are precursors in sperm development. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	8	1338	Worldwide incidence of testicular cancer is 7.5 cases per 100,000 men, but the rates vary remarkably between countries and according to ancestry, the ICR said in a press release. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	9	1526	Why this is so is unclear. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	10	1553	Inheritance, though, is a well-known risk factor and seems to be far higher than for other cancer types. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	11	1667	Studies have found that the risk to brothers of testicular cancer patients is eight to 10 times higher than the general population, while for fathers of patients, the risk is four to six times higher. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0127	12	1877	Testicular cancer is 99 percent curable if caught in its early stages, the ICR said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	0	58	Football: Perez could take charge again of Real on Monday 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	1	189	Former Real Madrid president Florentino Perez could automatically take charge again of Spain's historically most successful team on Monday if no other candidate throws in his hat to run for president by a deadline of midnight on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	2	435	The 62-year-old, who led Real from 2000 to 2006, was the only candidate for the post after former club vice-president Juan Onieva withdrew his candidacy last week, saying his proposed programme had not been well received. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	3	666	Under Perez, Real earned the nickname "Los Galacticos", winning the Primera Liga twice and the European Champions League with such stars as Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luis Figo and David Beckham. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	4	870	He officially presented his candidacy on Thursday under the slogan "the dream is back" and said the team he would help to build would be world beaters. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	5	1031	"We will build a spectacular team with top notch players. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	6	1089	We have set up a strong and stable sporting project which will be able to call upon footballers who will turn each Real Madrid match into a fascinating rendez-vous," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	7	1273	Perez has not mentioned any names regarding top signings but Spanish media has reported that Chilean Manuel Pellegrini, currently at Villarreal, would become coach in place of Juande Ramos and the club would also land AC Milan's Brazilian playmaker Kaka. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	8	1537	"I do not place any limit on myself," he said in an interview published Sunday in top-selling daily newspaper El Pais, adding the club "needs a revolution". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	9	1703	Barcelona won the Champions League, the Spanish title and the Spanish Cup in a superb season under debutant coach Pep Guardiola that left Real looking ordinary by comparison. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	10	1887	But Perez said the success of Real's arch-rivals this season "motivates me even more". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	11	1983	If there is more than one candidate for president, a vote will be held on June 14. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	12	2075	While the club normally holds elections every four years, it faces the prospect of holding a ballot a year early due to the resignation of former president Ramon Calderon in January. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	13	2267	That followed allegations he rigged voting at the club's last general assembly in December, which approved its financial accounts. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0128	14	2407	Calderon has been replaced on an interim basis by Vicente Boluda.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	1	195	Rafael Nadal's hopes of a record fifth successive French Open title were crushed into the Roland Garros red dust by Robin Soderling's Swedish sledgehammer on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	2	370	In one of the greatest upsets in the history of the tournament, the Spanish king of clay slumped to a first ever defeat here having racked up 31 wins in 31 outings since his 2005 debut. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	3	565	Soderling's stunning 6-2, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) fourth round victory came just a month after he'd won only one game in a 6-1, 6-0 rout at the Rome Masters, his third defeat in three matches against the world number one. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	4	798	But he was a man transformed on Sunday with the 24-year-old unleashing a formidable service game and a relentless, pinpoint accurate forehand which forced Nadal to constantly scramble for a foothold in the match. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	5	1020	"He didn't surprise me because I know how he plays and how dangerous he can be," said Nadal who had won the Monte Carlo, Rome and Barcelona events in the run-up to Roland Garros. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	6	1208	"I didn't play my best.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	12	1476	Soderling was in tears by the end. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	13	1520	"I just couldn't believe it when I won that last point," said the Swede who has never gone this far before in a Grand Slam. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	14	1653	"I'm so proud of myself. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	15	1678	This is the best win of my career against a man who is the greatest claycourt player in history." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	16	1785	Nadal's first set loss was the first time he had dropped a set in the tournament since the 2007 final against Roger Federer, ending a run of 32 in a row. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	17	1948	The Spaniard was reeling from the outset at the hands of a man whom he'd accused of being one of the most unpopular players in the locker room after an acrimonious Wimbledon clash two years ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	18	2152	Nadal was broken in the fourth game as 23rd seeded Soderling went to 4-1 ahead and again in the crucial eighth as the free-flowing, uninhibited Swede continued to find the corners with devastating accuracy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	19	2368	The 24-year-old deservedly claimed the opening set when the champion netted a backhand. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	20	2465	Nadal, despite missing his usual fluency and rattled by the unrelenting assault, broke for the first time to lead 2-1 in the second set only to surrender his advantage in the 10th game. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	21	2660	With most people inside Court Philippe Chatrier expecting a Nadal drive to fly past the big Swede, Soderling executed a fine backhand volley to go to 5-5. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	22	2824	Despite those heroics, Nadal ran away with the tiebreaker to level the match when, for once, Soderling's forehand missed its target and flew long. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	23	2980	The Swede, coached by compatriot and 2000 finalist Magnus Norman, refused to yield, breaking to lead 4-3 before backing it up for a 5-3 advantage in the third set. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	24	3153	He took the set when Nadal netted another weary forehand off yet another deep Soderling drive. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	25	3257	Nadal broke to lead 2-0 in the fourth set, but Soderling hit back immediately as another tiebreak loomed where the gallant Swede clinched his famous win on a second match point when Nadal went wide with a pick-up. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	26	3480	Soderling sent down nine aces in the match and fired a decisive 61 winners to the Spaniard's 33. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	27	3586	His reward is a match-up with either Russian 10th seed Nikolay Davydenko or Fernando Verdasco, the eighth-seeded Spaniard for a place in the semi-finals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0131	28	3749	Sunday's drama would have delighted Roger Federer, who has lost the last three finals to Nadal, and who still needs a French Open to complete a career Grand Slam.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	5	949	"Today my beautiful Milan adventure has come to an end," said a visibly emotional Ancelotti. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	6	1051	"Our paths are separating. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0132	7	1078	I spoke after the match to Mr Galliani and we decided to terminate the contract.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	1	203	Casey Stoner held off the fast-finishing Jorge Lorenzo to win the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday and bring to an end Valentino Rossi's seven-year reign here. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	2	368	The Australian also took over the lead in the world championship standings with his second win of the season having also triumphed in Qatar in the opening race of the season. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	3	552	He now leads Lorenzo, who started on pole here, by four points in the championship standings with Rossi third, a further five points back. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	4	700	In a dramatic race that began in wet conditions, Stoner seized the advantage when switching bikes after 10 laps for a change of tyres. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	5	844	"Once I got onto the slicks I found a good feeling immediately and I was able to get to the front quite quickly, but then I started having a problem with the clutch," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	6	1029	"It was a really hard race and I just wanted to finish it. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	7	1088	I just tried to stay smooth and keep the same lap times even if I couldn’t ride the way I wanted to." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	8	1199	He was the fastest man on the track by some margin in those first few laps after the switch and although Yamaha pair Lorenzo and Rossi were quickest at the end, they had both lost too much time and too many places to hit back. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	9	1435	Rossi blamed his team for making the wrong choice of tyre in the dry, going for the harder compound. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	10	1545	"It's a precious result, it's also nice to be on the podium. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	11	1606	The race was really difficult, we knew the weather would be terrible," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	12	1695	"In the dry we made a mistake in going with the hard tyres. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	13	1755	The choice of hards was made even though I wanted the soft ones." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	14	1830	Lorenzo said he was delighted with his finish having slid off on the warm-up lap and skidded at the start. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	15	1946	"Honestly, this is as good as a win for me and I can't really believe the race today, it was like a movie," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	16	2072	"It's a really amazing result because things could have been much worse today, so thank you again to everyone for making it possible. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	17	2206	I'm really happy with this result." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	18	2251	Stoner completed the 23 laps in 45min 41.894sec to beat Lorenzo by just over a second. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	19	2347	In an exciting race the pole-sitter got off to a terrible start in the wet and immediately dropped to eighth. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	20	2466	Quickest off the mark were Australian Chris Vermeulen, who started 11th, and Andrea Dovizioso, who began seventh but Stoner passed them both on the long straight at the beginning of the second lap. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	21	2673	Vermeulen quickly started heading backwards, eventually finishing 10th, as Rossi started to move up from fifth. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	22	2794	However Italian Marco Melandri on a Kawasaki, who started 15th on the grid, was clearly fastest in the wet. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	23	2911	Rossi took the lead from Dovizioso, who had got back past Stoner, on the seventh lap and two laps later he lost that to Melandri. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	24	3050	However, on the 10th lap all the front runners came into the pits for a change of bikes and when they came out, Stoner was quickest to find his pace. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	25	3209	Melandri immediately started heading backwards, eventually finishing 11th and 35sec back, while Loris Capirossi propelled himself into race contention with Stoner and Dovizioso. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	26	3396	Lorenzo and Rossi initially struggled with their bikes down in fifth and sixth and the time they lost over those first three laps coming out of the pits essentially cost either of them a chance of victory. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	27	3611	While Stoner had soon taken the race lead, both Yamaha riders had to then pass Melandri, Capirossi and Dovizioso and by the time they had done so, Stoner was over a second ahead and with only a couple of laps remaining. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	28	3840	Meanwhile former Superbikes champion James Toseland of Britain got his best finish of the season in seventh, benefitting from being the first man into the pits to change his bike. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0135	29	4029	It meant that his tyres were warm and he was flying as the fastest man on track for a few laps when everyone else was simply trying to get temperature into their new tyres. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	0	58	Rugby League:Huddersfield grab last gasp victory over Castleford 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	1	196	Danny Kirmond's late try saw Huddersfield reach the Challenge Cup semi-finals on Sunday as they beat Castleford 16-14. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	2	324	Kirmond's 77th minute try completed a great comeback for the hosts. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	3	401	Castleford had one foot in the semi-finals when Brett Ferres' converted try gave them a 14-6 lead ten minutes after the break. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	4	537	But the Giants hit back in the final 12 minutes through Stephen Wild before Kirmond crossed to snatch the win. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	5	657	Castleford had taken a fifth minute lead through Michael Shenton's try but Kevin Brown's four-pointer, converted by former Wests full-back Brett Hodgson, made it 6-6 at the break. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	6	846	Ferres and two goals from Kirk Dixon gave Cas a cushion but they were left stunned at the death. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	7	952	On Saturday Warrington stand-off Lee Briers dropped a golden-point drop-goal to dump in-form Hull KR out of the Challenge Cup, 25-24. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	8	1095	In a desperate search for the winning points, Briers had already failed with three drop goal attempts. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	9	1207	However, Briers refused to throw in the towel and finally succeeded on his fourth attempt to send the Wolves into the semi-finals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	10	1347	The tense victory avenged Warrington's quarter-final defeat in 2006, when then National League One side Rovers sprung a famous victory to secure a place in the last four. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	11	1527	The nailbiting quarter-final went to golden point time after the clash finished 24-24 after 80 minutes, thanks to Michael Dobson's last-gasp penalty. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	12	1686	The home side took the lead inside three minutes when Paul Cooke's pass allowed Peter Fox to send through Kris Welham under the posts. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	13	1830	The lead didn't last long as Warrington drew level thanks to Vinnie Anderson, which saw the first-half finish all square. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	14	1961	Warrington took the lead after the break as Jon Clarke touched down but the Robins bounced back with quick tries from ex-Newcastle Knights forward Clint Newton, Ben Galea and Jake Webster. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	15	2159	The visitors regained their composure and reduced the deficit to four points when Matt King touched down before Chris Bridge once again put the visitors in front. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	16	2331	A Dobson penalty levelled the scores just before full-time, forcing the match into a sudden-death golden-point thriller, until Briers' settled it. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	17	2487	St Helens eased into the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup with a thumping 12-try 66-6 victory over Gateshead. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	18	2606	The win also included Sean Long's 1,000th goal for the club, while former Australia centre Matt Gidley and ex-Sydney Roosters second-row Chris Flannery grabbed doubles for Saints. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	19	2795	Wigan moved to within a sight of a return to Wembley after an 11-year absence with a 28-6 win over Salford. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	20	2912	Former Wests winger Pat Richards was the star of the show with a hat-trick of tries and eight points with the boot. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	21	3037	In the weekend's only Super League fixture, Wakefield racked up a half century of points against Celtic Crusaders, winning 50-6. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	22	3175	Wakefield ran in nine tries, with the game all but over at the break as Trinity led by 30 points. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0136	23	3282	Trinity's tries came from Ryan Atkins, Michael Korkidas, Scott Grix, Danny Brough and Brad Drew before the break, while Jamie Rooney went over twice, before Steve Snitch and Drew, with his second, completed the rout.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0138	1	186	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday appointed a new envoy to head indirect negotiations on a prisoner swap with the Islamist Hamas rulers of the Gaza Strip. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0138	2	368	Hagai Hadas, a former commander in the Mossad spy agency, will oversee talks on the release of soldier Gilad Shalit, held in Gaza since his capture by Palestinian militants in June 2006, the premier's office said in a statement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0138	3	606	Hamas and Israel blame each other for the failure of negotiations in Cairo in mid-March aimed at securing a deal under which Israel would free hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Shalit. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0138	4	816	Ofer Dekel, the previous Israeli prisoner negotiator who was appointed by former prime minister Ehud Olmert, stepped down shortly after Netanyahu took office in March. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0138	5	993	The talks on a swap have not resumed since Netanyahu's right-leaning government took office at the start of April, and the premier has so far refused to say whether he accepts the framework of the previous negotiations. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0138	6	1222	Israel, which launched a devastating 22-day onslaught on Hamas in Gaza in December, has made the release of Shalit a precondition for a lasting ceasefire and an end to its blockade of the enclave. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0138	7	1428	A corporal at the time of his capture, Shalit has since been promoted to staff sergeant. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	0	58	Tennis: Safina powers on, Ivanovic heads home 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	1	176	Top seed Dinara Safina won at a canter to reach the French Open quarter-finals on Sunday but it will not be title-holder Ana Ivanovic she meets there after the Serb lost 6-2, 6-3 to Victoria Azarenka 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	2	385	The 23-year-old Russian brushed aside the challenge of France's Aravane Rezai 6-1, 6-0 in a centre-court mis-match and has conceded just five games in four matches. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	3	559	Also through and into her first Grand Slam quarter-final was Slovakia's Dominika Cibulkova who had too much movement about the court and allround ability for Agnes Szavay of Hungary winning 6-2, 6-4. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	4	768	She will play the winner of the day's remaining fourth round tie between former world No 1 Maria Sharpova of Russia and Li Na who is bidding to become the first Chinese player to reach the last eight at Roland Garros. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	5	995	Azaranka's win over Ivanovic was no great surprise as she has won three titles this year already while Ivanovic has been laid low with injury and poor form. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	6	1161	Two breaks of serve in the sixth and eighth games were enough to clinch the first set for the Arizona-based player and when she went 4-0 up in the second it was all but over. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	7	1345	With the crowd cheering for Ivanovic and jeering Azarenko, the Serb did manage two breaks of her own after that, but she could not hold onto her own serve allowing the Belarussian to close out the tie. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	8	1556	Azarenka said she had not been upset by the crowd clearly favouring her opponent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	9	1647	"It was expected because she was the champion, but I hope they will be little bit more for me now," she said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	10	1766	"It's the first time I have made the quarter-finals (of a Grand Slam) and it's a big step for me. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	11	1873	"It will be tough against Safina because she has lost only one match on clay this year and has been killing people, but I will be ready." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	12	2020	Ivanovic said she had been feeling unwell from the middle of the first set. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	13	2105	"I started really well and felt good, but after the third point of the fourth game I started to feel dizzy and lost my balance. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	14	2233	It was really hard after that." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	15	2274	Safina's win over Rezai was the perfect result for her as she closes in on winning a first Grand Slam title and proving to herself and her detractors that she is a worthy world No.1. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	16	2466	But it was a poor advertisement for women's tennis as the stage-struck Frenchwoman, who won her first tournament as a professional in Strasbourg earlier this month, capitulated in just 53 minutes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	17	2672	"Getting into the quarter-finals like this feels good," said Safina. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	18	2750	"I remember Australia (where she reached the final) this year and I don't know how many hours I needed there so I am feeling good right now. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0139	19	2900	"Since I became number one I am playing better and better."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0141	1	186	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday appointed a new envoy to head indirect negotiations on a prisoner swap with the Islamist Hamas rulers of the Gaza Strip.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	2	379	In resolutions at the end of its annual conference, the Movement for Democratic Change also called for a regional summit to resolve differences dogging the unity government between Tsvangirai and President Robert Mugabe. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	3	609	The MDC has long criticised Mugabe's decision to retain central bank chief Gideon Gono and attorney-general Johannes Tomana but Tsvangirai tried to take the heat out of the issue last week when he said their future should be decided by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), a regional bloc. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	4	922	However in the resolutions, the MDC said both men should go immediately.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	8	1825	The prime minister sought to reassure his supporters at the end of the conference saying he had not abandoned the party's objectives. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	9	1968	"The transitional government, which is a coalition government is a stepping stone to a new and democratic Zimbabwe," he said but expressing disappoitment at delays in implementing the coalition agreement.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	14	2602	The MDC is particularly keen to see the back of Gono, who has been widely criticised for failing to stop the Zimbabwean economy's freefall and slide into world record inflation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0146	15	2789	Tomana is also accused of having overseen politically-inspired prosecutions in the aftermath of last year's disputed presidential election.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0147	2	328	Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani then announced that former player and Brazil World Cup winning midfielder Leonardo, the club's technical director, would be taking over the hot-seat.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0147	4	695	Ancelotti, who still had a year to run on his contract, confirmed what had become the worst kept secret in Italian football in announcing his departure, however he refused to confirm that Chelsea would be his destination. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0147	5	926	"Our paths are separating. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0147	6	953	I spoke after the match to Mr Galliani and we decided to terminate the contract.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	1	178	Rafael Nadal's hopes of a record fifth successive French Open title were crushed into the Roland Garros red dust by Robin Soderling's Swedish sledgehammer on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	2	353	In one of the greatest upsets in the tournament's history, the Spanish king of clay slumped to a first ever defeat here having racked up 31 wins in 31 outings since his 2005 debut. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	3	543	Soderling's stunning 6-2, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) victory came just a month after he'd won only one game in a 6-1, 6-0 rout at the Rome Masters, his third defeat in three matches against the world number one. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	4	763	But he was man transformed on Sunday with the 24-year-old unleashing a formidable service game and a relentless, pinpoint accurate forehand which forced Nadal to constantly scramble for a foothold in the match. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	5	983	"I just couldn't believe it when I won that last point," said a tearful Soderling who has never gone this far before in a Grand Slam. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	6	1126	"I'm so proud of myself. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	7	1151	This is the best win of my career against a man who is the greatest claycourt player in history. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	8	1248	But I told myself before the match that I had to believe I could win." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	9	1328	Nadal's first set loss was the first time he had dropped a set in the tournament since the 2007 final against Roger Federer, ending a run of 32 in a row. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	10	1491	The Spaniard was reeling from the outset at the hands of a man whom he'd accused of being one of the most unpopular players in the locker room after an acrimonious Wimbledon clash two years ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	11	1695	Nadal was broken in the fourth game as 23rd seeded Soderling went to 4-1 ahead and again in the crucial eighth as the free-flowing, uninhibited Swede continued to find the corners with devastating accuracy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	12	1911	The 24-year-old deservedly claimed the opening set when the champion netted a backhand. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	13	2008	Nadal, despite missing his usual fluency and rattled by the unrelenting assault, broke for the first time to lead 2-1 in the second set only to surrender his advantage in the 10th game. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	14	2203	With most people inside Court Philippe Chatrier expecting a Nadal drive to fly past the big Swede, Soderling executed a fine backhand volley to go to 5-5. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	15	2367	Despite those heroics, Nadal ran away with the tiebreaker to level the match when, for once, Soderling's forehand missed its target and flew long. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	16	2523	The Swede, coached by compatriot and 2000 finalist Magnus Norman, refused to yield, breaking to lead 4-3 before backing it up for a 5-3 advantage in the third set. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	17	2696	He took the set when Nadal netted another weary forehand off yet another deep Soderling drive. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	18	2800	Nadal broke to lead 2-0 in the fourth set, but Soderling hit back immediately as another tiebreak loomed where the gallant Swede clinched his famous win on a second match point when Nadal went wide with a pick-up. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0148	19	3023	Soderling sent down nine aces in the match and fired a decisive 61 winners to the Spaniard's 33.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	1	203	Casey Stoner held off the fast-finishing Jorge Lorenzo to win the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday and bring to an end Valentino Rossi's seven-year reign here. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	2	368	The Australian also took over the lead in the world championship standings with his second win of the season having also triumphed in Qatar in the opening race of the season. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	3	552	He now leads Lorenzo, who started on pole here, by four points in the championship standings with Rossi third, a further five points back. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	4	700	Rossi blamed his team for making the wrong choice of tyre in the dry, going for the harder compound. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	5	810	"It's a precious result, it's also nice to be on the podium. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	6	871	The race was really difficult, we knew the weather would be terrible," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	7	960	"In the dry we made a mistake in going with the hard tyres. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	8	1020	The choice of hards was made even though I wanted the soft ones." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	9	1095	Lorenzo said he was delighted with his finish having slid off on the warm-up lap and skidded at the start. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	10	1211	"Honestly, this is as good as a win for me and I can’t really believe the race today, it was like a movie," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	11	1337	"This morning in the warm-up I was quite worried because I was slow in the rain, then on the formation lap I slid off into the gravel pit. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	12	1485	"On the grid I tried not to think about the crash, I just tried to focus. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	13	1559	But then I had a big slide off the line and the first part of the race wasn’t so good for me. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	14	1662	"It’s a really amazing result because things could have been much worse today, so thank you again to everyone for making it possible.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	16	1841	In a dramatic race that began in wet conditions, Stoner seized the advantage when switching bikes after 10 laps for a change of tyres. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	17	1985	He was the fastest man on the track by some margin in those first few laps after the switch and although Yamaha pair Lorenzo and Rossi were quickest at the end, they had both lost too much time and too many places to hit back. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	18	2221	Stoner completed the 23 laps in 45min 41.894sec to beat Lorenzo by just over a second. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	19	2317	In an exciting race the pole-sitter got off to a terrible start in the wet and immediately dropped to eighth. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	20	2436	Quickest off the mark were Australian Chris Vermeulen, who started 11th, and Andrea Dovizioso, who began seventh but Stoner passed them both on the long straight at the beginning of the second lap. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	21	2643	Vermeulen quickly started heading backwards, eventually finishing 10th, as Rossi started to move up from fifth. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	22	2764	However Italian Marco Melandri on a Kawasaki, who started 15th on the grid, was clearly fastest in the wet. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	23	2881	Rossi took the lead from Dovizioso, who had got back past Stoner, on the seventh lap and two laps later he lost that to Melandri. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	24	3020	However, on the 10th lap all the front runners came into the pits for a change of bikes and when they came out, Stoner was quickest to find his pace. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	25	3179	Melandri immediately started heading backwards, eventually finishing 11th and 35sec back, while Loris Capirossi propelled himself into race contention with Stoner and Dovizioso. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	26	3366	Lorenzo and Rossi initially struggled with their bikes down in fifth and sixth and the time they lost over those first three laps coming out of the pits, essentially cost either of them a chance of victory. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	27	3582	While Stoner had soon taken the race lead, both Yamaha riders had to then pass Melandri, Capirossi and Dovizioso and by the time they had done so, Stoner was over a second ahead and with only a couple of laps remaining. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0152	28	3811	Meanwhile former Superbikes champion James Toseland of Britain got his best finish of the season in seventh, benefitting from being the first man into the pits to change his bike.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	3	455	Italian 2007 champion Danilo Di Luca finished second with his compatriot Franco Pellizzoti rounding off the podium finishers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	4	590	Lithuanian Ignatas Konovalovas of the Cervelo team won the final stage in a time of 18min 42sec with Briton Bradley Wiggins only a second back and Norway's Edvald Boasson Hagen in third. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	5	786	Menchov finished 10th on the stage with Di Luca 16th. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	6	849	The Russian had a 20sec lead coming into the final day in one of the closest ever finishes to a Giro, in it's centenary year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	7	984	Di Luca briefly looked to be on the brink of a famous victory when he got to the first time check fastest of all and 5sec up on Menchov. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	8	1130	But the LPR rider had blasted out too fast, gradually fading from there and he was 14sec down on Menchov at the next time check. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	9	1268	When he came over the line, Di Luca had lost 45sec to Konovalovas whereas Menchov, who had won the 12th stage time-trial to take over the pink jersey last Thursday, was getting stronger. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	10	1464	The Russian looked like he may even win the final time-trial as well but with rain spitting down drama unfolded in the final kilometre. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	11	1609	Riding in a straight line but on a cobbled section, Menchov suddenly crashed with just 1km left to ride. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	12	1723	However quick thinking from his mechanic may have secured him the victory. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	13	1807	As Menchov was still sliding along the wet surface, his mechanic had already jumped out of the team car and was unloading another bike from the roof. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	14	1966	Menchov went to pick up his splayed bike but received a shout from the mechanic and instead jumped straight onto the new one and was back on his way, courtesy of a push from the mechanic as well. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	15	2171	He had been going so well, though, that he still had time to spare on Di Luca and despite the crash he gained 21sec on his rival to win by 41sec overall. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0153	16	2334	Pellizotti finished just under two minutes down with Tour de France champion Carlos Sastre fourth and seven-time Tour winner Lance Armstrong 12th.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	1	192	Senior Red Cross officials who visited Pakistan's Swat Valley said Sunday they were "gravely concerned" over the humanitarian situation as Pakistani soldiers battled to crush the Taliban. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	2	389	"The organisation is gravely concerned about the plight of civilians in Swat and believes their situation demands a prompt and comprehensive humanitarian response," said a statement released from the Geneva headquarters of the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC). 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	3	675	"The ICRC will do its utmost to meet those needs without delay," said Pascal Cuttat, head of the organisation's delegation in Pakistan. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	4	820	"Given what we have already seen on the ground, we are mobilising additional resources, but safe and unimpeded access to the area remains essential for our teams to deliver," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	5	1014	Aid workers had been alarmed at what they saw when they entered the region, where the fighting between the Pakistani army and Taliban fighters for the pass month has left civilians trapped and isolated for weeks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	6	1236	"There is no running water, no electricity, and food is scarce," said Daniel O'Malley, who led the IRCR team into the region. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	7	1371	"Phone lines are down, so people have been cut off from the outside world and are anxious for contact with relatives who fled the area," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	8	1527	Red Cross workers were also disturbed at conditions in Khwazakhela hospital, one of the few medical facilities still left operating in Swat. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	9	1677	"The handful of hospital staff left are struggling to work without any water, electricity or supplies," said O'Malley. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	10	1805	"They simply cannot cope with the influx of patients." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	11	1869	The Red Cross evacuated 14 patients from the hospital. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	12	1933	Pakistan's defence secretary Syed Athar Ali said Sunday the army was gaining on the Taliban and fighting could be over in a few days. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	13	2076	Swat valley's main town Mingora is back in government hands, a critical milestone in an offensive launched after the Taliban thrust to within 100 kilometres (60 miles) of Islamabad in April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	14	2276	The defence chief told a security forum in Singapore that three targeted northwest districts were almost clear of Taliban rebels. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	15	2415	"Only five to 10 percent of the job is remaining and hopefully within the next two to three days these pockets of resistance will be cleared," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	16	2576	The United States, which is firmly backing the current military drive, had warned that the rebels threaten Pakistan's very existence. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	17	2719	Also Sunday the military relaxed a curfew Sunday in most parts of the northwest including Mingora to allow people trapped on the roads to return home or leave the region. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	18	2899	The ICRC is one of the very few humanitarian organizations working in Swat before the conflict broke out and has been trying to return there since early this month. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	19	3064	Despite some openings it said access to areas affected by the fighting remains too limited. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0154	20	3165	It also continues to support camps run by the Pakistan Red Crescent Society, where over 20,000 people driven from their homes by the fighting are currently living.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	1	192	Unlikely Scottish singing sensation Susan Boyle was plotting her future Sunday after her defeat in the "Britain's Got Talent" television show, which made her a worldwide star thanks to Internet exposure. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	2	405	Boyle, a frumpy, 48-year-old church volunteer, will reportedly earn up to eight million pounds (nine million euros, 13 million dollars) in the next year from a record deal, a book about her life and even a film. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	3	626	She is set to start rehearsing for an album of showtunes this week and will fly to Prague next month for recording sessions with the Czech National Symphony Orchestra, British media said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	4	823	Boyle's career looks likely to reach new heights even though she lost to the multi-ethnic street dancers Diversity in a public vote after the live talent show final late Saturday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	5	1012	Despite winning praise from the audience and the judges, she was forced into second place. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	6	1103	The "best people won", she said, wishing the dance troupe winners "all the best". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	7	1194	After the contest, "Britain's Got Talent" judge Piers Morgan called her "the greatest discovery the show's ever found". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	8	1323	He added: "I'm only sorry that the extraordinary tidal wave of publicity she attracted meant so many people got either bored or irritated by Boyle mania and decided not to vote for her as a result," he wrote on his blog. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	9	1553	Boyle has enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame over the past two months after video footage of her audition piece for the show, "I Dreamed A Dream" from the musical "Les Miserables", was posted on YouTube. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	10	1763	It has had at least 100 million hits and brought her celebrity fans including actress Demi Moore and rock star Jon Bon Jovi, who embraced the dowdy spinster from small-town Scotland with a voice worthy of Broadway. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	11	1987	Bookmakers made her the favourite to win, but after an unconvincing semi-final performance, there were fears that Boyle, who was starved of oxygen at birth and has mild learning difficulties, was suffering under the pressure. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	12	2222	She was spoken to by police after an outburst at the London hotel where she was staying, while Morgan described her as "a frightened rabbit in headlights" and said she had considered quitting the contest. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	13	2436	But in a live performance in the final Saturday, she proved the critics wrong and repeated her audition piece with gusto. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	14	2567	Following her performance, Boyle -- wearing a grey-blue, long sequined dress -- was asked if it was worth all the media pressure, she replied: "Well worth it!... 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	15	2729	I really feel at home on stage, I'm among friends." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	16	2790	As for her future plans, she added: "I hope to get an album out -- I'll just play it by ear. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	17	2883	What a journey -- unbelievable, and very humbling." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	18	2944	A total of 19.2 million people watched the show in Britain, making it the most popular television programme for five years. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	19	3077	Just under four million people voted, broadcaster ITV said, with 24.9 percent backing Diversity and 20.2 percent Boyle. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	20	3206	Boyle's performance was also watched by hundreds of fans in her home town of Blackburn, outside Edinburgh, where she lives in social housing with only her cat Pebbles for company. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	21	3395	"She told me that after the final, she wants to come back and resume her previous life," one of Boyle's neighbours, 24-year-old housewife Vicky McLean told the Mail on Sunday newspaper. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	22	3590	"She doesn't want to make millions and go to America, she just wants to sing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0161	23	3668	I think all she really hopes to have out of it is enough money to buy her house."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	1	181	Pakistan captain Younus Khan said the upcoming ICC World Twenty20 in England had a special significance for his side after their country had become a virtual 'no-go zone' for international cricket.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	4	616	With no international side willing to travel to Pakistan, Younus's men recently returned to international action in the United Arab Emirates against Australia, where they lost 3-2 in a one-day series but won the lone Twenty20. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	5	852	"It is special to be back on the world stage, especially in Twenty20 and in England, the media are here so lots of hopes are here," the talented batsman told reporters at Lord's here on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	6	1055	"We are suffering from not playing regularly, and no-one is coming to Pakistan," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	7	1155	Pakistan endured a nailbiting defeat at the hands of arch-rivals India in the 2007 World Twenty20 final in South Africa and Younus would love nothing more than for his team to go one better this time. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	8	1365	"My confidence is that I'll take this trophy to Pakistan," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	9	1433	But such has been Pakistan's relative lack of international cricket that he added: "It will be an achievement for us to finish in the top four." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	10	1587	Reflecting on the 2007 final, Younus said: "The finishing touches were not there. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	11	1669	We needed only five runs.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	14	1871	Twenty20 tends to put a premium on big-hitting batsmen at the start of the innings but Younus, whose team face England and the Netherlands in Group B, said it was not necessary to start going for big shots right from the off. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	15	2106	"Twenty20 looks short, but it's not - 120 balls is enough. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	16	2174	"If you bat normally but with energy, especially in the middle order and with good runners between the wickets, 180-90 is very easy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	17	2316	"In English conditions the new ball does seam, so you need someone like Salman Butt who can play for 20 overs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	18	2427	But in the middle order, we have big hitters like Shahid Afridi and Misbah-Ul-Haq." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0163	19	2520	English officials have already announced that plans are well advanced for Pakistan to play two Tests against Australia in England next year as well as a series with Andrew Strauss's men.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0166	1	184	Myanmar's military junta accused Aung San Suu Kyi Sunday of covering up a visit to her home by a US man which led to her trial, as the pro-democracy icon hit back against the "bullying" generals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0166	2	389	The regime said the Nobel laureate was not above the law and issued its sternest warning yet against foreign interference in the case, under which she faces up to five years' jail for breaching her house arrest. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0166	3	610	Aung San Suu Kyi has proclaimed her innocence at the closed prison trial, insisting that she only offered "temporary shelter" to American John Yettaw after he swam to her lakeside house, and has branded the proceedings as biased. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0166	4	849	"It is no doubt that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has committed a cover-up of the truth by her failure to report an illegal immigrant to the authorities concerned," Major General Aye Myint, Myanmar's deputy defence minister, told a security forum in Singapore.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0167	9	1485	Some 54 percent of those polled thought Labour had been worst affected by the expenses scandal, compared to 13 percent for the Conservatives.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0167	14	2032	"People are angry rightly because they are worried when they see taxpayers' money wasted on their MPs and they're finding it very difficult... in a difficult economic situation," he added, referring to Britain's recession.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0167	18	2804	Turnout at European elections in Britain is usually low -- in the last polls in 2004, it was just 38 percent, due in part to strong Eurosceptic sentiment among many.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	0	58	Zimbabwe PM's party says central bank chief must resign 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	1	187	Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's party bemoaned the slow pace of change in Zimbabwe's fledgling coalition on Sunday, calling for the central bank chief and attorney general to quit immediately. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	2	392	In resolutions at the end of its annual conference, the Movement for Democratic Change also called for a regional summit to resolve differences dogging the unity government between Tsvangirai and President Robert Mugabe. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	3	622	The MDC has long criticised Mugabe's decision to retain central bank chief Gideon Gono and attorney-general Johannes Tomana but Tsvangirai tried to take the heat out of the issue last week when he said their future should be decided by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), a regional bloc. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	4	935	However in the resolutions, the MDC said both men should go immediately. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	5	1017	"Aware of the conflict and divisive effect of the issues ... conference calls that in the national interest Johannes Tomana and Gideon Gono resign forthwith," the MDC said in resolutions read by secretary-general Tendai Biti, who is also Zimbabwe's finance minister. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	6	1293	Tsvangirai encountered tough resistance within the MDC about entering a power- sharing deal with Mugabe in February and the resolution made clear the party is unhappy about what it sees as a lack of reform and continued intimidation of its supporters by pro-Mugabe militias. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	7	1577	The government must address "the slow pace of media reforms, slow implementation of the government 100-day plan, continued deployment of the military in villages and the existence of militia and ghost workers on the government payroll," it said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	8	1832	The MDC is particularly keen to see the back of Gono, who has been widely criticised for failing to stop the Zimbabwean economy's freefall and slide into world record inflation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	9	2019	Tomana is also accused of having overseen politically-inspired prosecutions in the aftermath of last year's disputed presidential election. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	10	2168	Tsvangirai won the first round of voting in March last year but pulled out of a run-off after scores of MDC were killed in attacks the party blamed on Mugabe's followers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	11	2348	The conference also called on the inclusive government to support victims of political violence. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0169	12	2454	"Concerned with the plight of victims of political violence ... conference resolves that the inclusive government vigilantly addresses the issue of the welfare of victims," the party said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	0	58	Tennis: Azarenka dethrones Queen Ana at French Open 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	1	182	Belarussian teenager Victoria Azarenka sunk Ana Ivanovic's hopes of defending her French Open crown with a comprehensive 6-2, 6-3 win in the fourth round on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	2	356	It is the first time the 19-year-old has reached the last eight at a Grand Slam event and she will play Russian top seed Dinara Safina for a place in the semi- finals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	3	533	The 21-year-old Ivanovic, meanwhile, was left pondering what she has to do to re-discover the form that brought her the title and world No.1 spot a year ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	4	700	Azarenka, with three titles to her name this year already, was the first to break thanks to a blistering crosscourt backhand in the third game. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	5	853	Ivanovic, who has battled for form and fitness since her triumph here last year, had her chances to break back in the following game but failed to take them. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	6	1020	She paid the penalty for that three games later when Azarenka collected a second break of serve forcing her opponent to hit long on break point at the end of a long, punishing rally. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	7	1212	Azarenka, a former world junior No.1, comfortably served out for the set despite opening with a double fault. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	8	1331	Both players were wearing high-tech strapping on their knees, the right for Ivanovic and the left for Azarenko, a clear sign of the injury epidemic that has beset women's tennis. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	9	1519	Ivanovic was put under severe pressure on her serve again at the start of the second set and after saving a handful of break points she finally succumbed by hitting a forehand a fraction long. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	10	1721	That was all Azarenka needed to further assert her authority in the match with Ivanovic looking increasingly out of sorts and unsure of herself. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	11	1875	The crowd were firmly behind the Serb, but it made no difference as Azarenko jumped out into a commanding 4-0 lead. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	12	2000	Ivanovic did manage to claw two games back to get to 4-2, but Azarenka snuffed out any hope she had of a comeback by breaking the Serbian's serve again in the next game. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0173	13	2179	She failed to serve out for the match but broke Ivanovic for the sixth time in the match in the following game to go through.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0174	1	166	Kuwait's Oil Minister Sheikh Ahmad Abdullah al-Sabah said on Sunday the OPEC member does not favour a high price for oil because this would dampen the global economy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0174	2	342	"We are not in favour to see the prices in the hundreds (of dollars a barrel) because this will fuel recession again," the minister told reporters outside parliament. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0174	3	518	He said Kuwait, the fourth largest Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries producer, is happy with OPEC's decision to keep production unchanged and ruled out any output cut when the organisation meets again in September. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0174	4	754	Asked about the recent increase in oil prices, Sheikh Ahmad said: "The market is reacting to sentiment rather than fundamentals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0174	5	883	There is a lot of supply but the prices are rising." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0174	6	945	The minister expects prices to increase to around 70 dollars a barrel as winter appoaches. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0174	7	1036	"We are approaching winter and definitely demand will increase." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0174	8	1110	Last July oil prices surged above 147 dollars a barrel before plunging to barely 32 dollars in December. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0174	9	1224	Continuing their recent recovery, prices shot back above 66 dollars a barrel on Friday on further signs of economic recovery and a weakening of the US currency.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	0	58	Palestinian tensions flare in deadly shoot-out 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	1	189	Six people were killed in a West Bank shoot-out on Sunday when an attempt to arrest a senior Hamas commander went awry, deepening the rift between the two main Palestinian factions. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	2	380	The Islamist Hamas movement ruling the Gaza Strip warned that the rival Fatah group loyal to president Mahmud Abbas had crossed a "red line" over the killing of one of its top fighters in the arrest operation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	3	599	The firefight erupted when Palestinian police dominated by Fatah tried to arrest Mohammed al-Samman, commander of Hamas's armed wing in the northern West Bank, who was also on Israel's wanted list. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	4	806	Samman barricaded himself into a house in the town of Qalqiliya in the north of the Israeli-occupied territory together with Mohammed Yassin, another Hamas militant, police and Hamas said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	5	1004	The ensuing shoot-out killed both Hamas men, three Palestinian policemen and a civilian. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	6	1093	A curfew was imposed on the town near the border with Israel following the incident, police said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	7	1200	Hamas branded the incident a "red line" and said it laid "complete responsibility of this ugly crime on Abbas and his security forces." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	8	1345	Describing Abbas and his forces as agents of arch-enemy Israel, Hamas said in a statement that it would respond "with acts," without elaborating. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	9	1500	"There is no difference between the occupation who shoots and the people who carry out their missions for them," a spokesman for Hamas's armed wing said at a news conference in Gaza. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	10	1692	The deep-seated rivalries between Hamas and Fatah boiled over in June 2007 when the Islamists violently seized control of Gaza, causing a split in Palestinian ranks that has become a key stumbling block in efforts to reach Middle East peace. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	11	1943	Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhum said there was no chance of further reconciliation talks with Fatah after the "escalation by security services of Abu Mazen and Fatah against Hamas and its leaders in the West Bank." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	12	2164	"Fatah should choose -- dialogue with us or doing the dirty work of the Zionist enemy," Barhum said as Hamas decried the killing over mosque loudspeakers in Gaza City. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	13	2341	A senior official from the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority dismissed the Hamas accusations as "lies." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	14	2452	"The Palestinian Authority has one duty -- to impose security and the law and we will not allow what happened in Gaza to happen here in the West Bank under any circumstances," he said on condition of anonymity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	15	2672	A spokesman for Palestinian security forces, Adnan Damiri, defended the arrest operation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	16	2771	"We in the Palestinian security branches are not a political force. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	17	2839	We are security. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	18	2856	We will not allow any Palestinian party to have guns and threaten civilians." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	19	2943	Damiri also said that during the arrest, police discovered Hamas leaflets containing "incitement against the Palestinian Authority and against the Palestinian security branches." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	20	3131	"We consider what happened today as very dangerous," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	21	3193	"It was an attempt to destroy any hope of resuming the (reconciliation) dialogue." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	22	3285	Abbas's power base has been limited to the occupied West Bank since Hamas ousted his Fatah party from the Gaza Strip, which remains under a crippling Israeli blockade. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	23	3462	The rival factions held five rounds of talks under Egyptian mediation in an attempt to reconcile but to no avail, and each side frequently accuses the other of launching campaigns of persecution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	24	3667	Palestinians are pessimistic about the two sides reconciling, with 51 percent saying that unity between Gaza and the West Bank will happen only after a long time and 27 percent saying the split is permanent, said a poll released on Sunday by the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research (PSR). 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	25	3979	Rights group Amnesty International has lambasted both Hamas and Fatah for arbitrary detentions, torture and suppression of freedom of speech in their respective areas of control. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0175	26	4167	On May 20 the Western-backed Abbas swore in a new Palestinian cabinet that includes members of Fatah but not Hamas, further widening the sectarian rift.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0176	2	358	The body of 52-year-old Melbourne resident Michael David was found on Sunday afternoon in a guest house 15 kilometres (9 miles) from the state capital of Patna, police said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0176	3	541	"Authorities of the guest house alerted the police as Michael did not open the door. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0176	4	626	We broke the door and found him dead," police inspector Chandra Prakash told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0176	5	717	The body has been sent for post-mortem examination and the Australian embassy has been informed about the incident, he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0176	6	851	Police said the man had been staying in the guest house since May 29 and had arrived in India on May 16 on a tourist visa. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0176	7	983	Caste and religion-based strongmen along with Maoist rebels have almost free reign in Bihar, where at least 5,000 murders and 12,000 abductions take place every year, according to police figures.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0178	1	181	With bankruptcy and a government takeover looming for auto giant General Motors, three prominent US business leaders cautioned Sunday that the government should get out of corporate boardrooms as quickly as possible. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0178	2	407	"I think all of us understand the need for the government to intervene and take the actions they did," said Anne Mulcahy, chief executive of Xerox. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0178	3	555	"But I also think there's a need for an exit plan." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0178	4	616	General Motors was poised to file for bankruptcy protection as early as Monday when a deadline imposed by the administration of President Barack Obama for submitting a viable restructuring or declare bankruptcy comes due. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0178	5	847	A government rescue plan for GM could put as much as 72.5 percent of the country's biggest automaker under state ownership. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0178	6	971	Chrysler already has led the way to bankruptcy courts. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0178	7	1035	The CEOs interviewed on NBC television's Sunday talk show said GM should use the bankruptcy courts and a government bailout to dramatically restructure, shedding labor costs and excess capacity to emerge stronger, leaner and more competitive. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0178	8	1287	But they also expressed concern about the longer-term implications of government control of the auto giants. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0178	9	1405	"I think that's fundamentally unhealthy," said Jim Owens, chief executive of Caterpillar. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0178	10	1495	"The federal government needs to be in and out." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0178	11	1553	"They need to help get the restructuring done. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0178	12	1600	But I think, fundamentally, the American public, I think they want to choose the best vehicle, the best car. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0178	13	1709	And American manufacturers need to be focused on competing," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0178	14	1788	Google's Eric Schmidt noted that the US stimulus package was designed to cover a two year period. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0178	15	1895	"It's very important that government get out of business and let business do its thing," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0178	16	1993	"The most important thing to remember, I think, is that jobs, wealth, are created in the private sector. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0178	17	2098	That's about capitalism." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0178	18	2133	"The other thing that has to happen is you've got to change the rules so we don't end up with all these organizations that are too big to fail again," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0178	19	2293	"We've done a fine job bailing them out.  
AFP_ENG_20090531.0178	20	2335	Let's only do this once per lifetime." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0178	21	2383	He said the auto companies are going to be "highly incentivized to get all that government money back out." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0178	22	2500	"Because the last thing you want is the government in your board room telling you what to do," he said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	1	175	AC Milan booked their place in the Champions League group stages and gave Paolo Maldini a winning send-off as they beat Fiorentina 2-0 on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	2	330	The seven-time European champions risked missing out on a top three finish and having to negotiate two qualifying rounds in Europe next season if they lost but goals from Kaka and Pato were enough to secure a win and third place in Serie A. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	3	580	Fiorentina finished fourth following the defeat and will play those two qualifying rounds next season while Juventus claimed second spot with a 2-0 home win over Lazio. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	4	758	But while Maldini was afforded a great reception from both sets of fans in Florence to celebrate his 24 years as a Milan player, coach Carlo Ancelotti made what will likely be a more discreet departure. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	5	970	He too is likely to leave Milan to join Chelsea next season, despite Milan's fans chanting for him to stay throughout the game. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	6	1107	Fiorentina, who had to win to take a top three finish, started brightly and former Milan forward Alberto Gilardino got on the end of a left-wing cross on 22-minutes but headed wide under pressure. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	7	1313	Just two minutes later former Arsenal star Mathieu Flamini grazed the bar with a vicious shot from 22 yards as Milan demonstrated their potency. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	8	1467	Fiorentina had a good shout for a penalty on 42 minutes when Giuseppe Favalli appeared to haul down Gilardino but the referee gave a foul the other way. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	9	1629	On 48 minutes the striker went close again as he curled a shot just past the post with the outside of his right boot. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	10	1756	But on 55 minutes Milan took the lead with a simple move as Andrea Pirlo released Gianluca Zambrotta down the right and although his cross was blocked by Alessandro Gamberini, Kaka followed up to slide home the ball. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	11	1982	Filippo Inzaghi should have finished things on 62 minutes but he blazed over the bar with only French goalkeeper Sebastien Frey to beat. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	12	2128	However substitute Pato did seal the victory on 76 minutes as he beat the offside trap and then chipped Frey as the Frenchman went to ground. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	13	2279	Champions Inter Milan came back from 3-2 down to beat Atalanta 4-3 at the San Siro as Portugal veteran Luis Figo also bowed out from the game. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	14	2431	Sweden forward Zlatan Ibrahimvoic also took the golden boot award after his two goals took his tally to 25 this season. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	15	2560	Czech veteran Pavel Nedved was another player departing as he played his final game for Juventus, with two Vincenzo Iaquinta goals securing their victory. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0181	16	2724	Torino joined Reggina and Lecce in being relegated to Serie B after they lost 3-2 at AS Roma and Bologna won 3-1 at home to Catania.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0182	1	190	A solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is more important to Egypt than confronting Iran's nuclear programme, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's spokesman Suleiman Awad said on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0182	2	391	The government hopes US President Barack Obama will address in his speech from Cairo on Thursday the "essence of the Islamic world's relations with the US... and that is peace in the Middle East," Awad said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0182	3	608	"Egypt and President Mubarak's priority is the Palestinian cause," state news agency MENA quoted him as saying. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0182	4	729	He was referring to what he called "Israeli media reports" of Israel and Arab countries being equally threatened by Iran's nuclear programme. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0182	5	880	Israel along with main ally Washington suspects Iran of trying to develop atomic weapons under the guise of a civilian nuclear programme, a charge Tehran has repeatedly denied.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0189	1	192	Nearly 600 symbols of the right-wing dictatorship of General Francisco Franco still adorn public buildings in Spain more than 30 years after his death, a newspaper reported Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0189	2	382	More than half of the remaining 585 symbols of the regime are on defence ministry buildings as many military leaders are reluctant to have them removed, said the daily newspaper Publico, citing a government report. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0189	3	606	Under a law passed in 2007 by the governing Socialists, towns are obliged to remove public symbols of the Franco era and rename streets named after the dictator or the generals who fought with him in Spain's 1936-1939 civil war. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0189	4	844	But it allows for exceptions to be made if valid artistic, historical or religious reasons are given for a symbol to remain in place. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0189	5	987	The government report cited by Publico was drawn up to determine which symbols of the regime should be "removed, hidden or neutralised" and which should be allowed to remain. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0189	6	1171	The Franco symbols that remain are mostly depictions of the coat of arms of the regime, which include the Eagle of St John. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0189	7	1304	The last public statue of Franco still on display on mainland Spain was taken down from a central square in the northern city of Santander in December 2008. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0189	8	1470	Franco ruled Spain with an iron fist from 1939 until his death in 1975 at the age of 82, which paved the way for the country's return to democracy.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0190	1	194	Andy Murray reached his first French Open quarter-final on Sunday where he will face big-hitting Fernando Gonazalez who almost missed Roland Garros due to a freak injury caused by signing autographs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0190	2	403	Third seed Murray became only the third British man in the Open era to reach the last eight here with a convincing 7-5, 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 win over Croatia's Marin Cilic. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0190	3	579	The ever-improving 22-year-old, with former two-time Roland Garros finalist Alex Corretja helping hone his claycourt game, looked in impressive physical condition with a series of long, punishing rallies eventually telling on the 13th seeded Cilic, the youngest man left in the draw. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0190	4	872	"I'm playing well." said Murray.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0190	12	1616	The 28-year-old, who outgunned Romania's Victor Hanescu 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 to reach the Roland Garros quarter-finals for the third time, injured his ankle while signing photos and tennis balls for fans at the Rome Masters in April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0190	13	1852	As a result, he spent a month on the sidelines. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0190	14	1909	"I was signing autographs and someone called me from the other side of the court and when I ran over to them, I twisted my ankle," said Gonzalez. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0190	15	2064	"I think I only managed to sign two and then I had to go back to the locker room because my ankle was so painful." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0190	16	2188	The freak accident meant Gonzalez had to skip the rest of the claycourt season to recover in time for the French Open. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0190	17	2316	But despite the Rome scare, he believes he is now playing some of the best tennis of his 10-year career. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0190	18	2430	"I think on average I am playing my best," said Gonzalez who made the semi- finals in Rome where he was defeated by Rafael Nadal before being completely finished off by his injury. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0190	19	2620	"I have played at a good level almost in every match.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0191	3	559	A small group of demonstrators had shouted, "Liberty for political prisoners," before being arrested. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0191	4	670	A police officer cited by the Ria Novosti agency said about 30 people had been arrested  for having tried to block Tverskaya Street, a main road in the capital.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0192	1	186	A Danish sculptor who flew to Hong Kong to protest the bloody crackdown on pro- democracy protests in Beijing 20 years ago has been refused entry to the city, an official and a legislator said Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0192	2	396	Jens Galschiot, whose sculpture commemorating those who died in the 1989 military crackdown, "Pillar of Shame," is displayed at Hong Kong University, was stopped by officials Saturday, an immigration spokesman said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0192	3	621	Albert Ho, the chairman of the Democratic Party and a lawyer, said the Dane was detained for five hours before being put on a flight to Zurich late Saturday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0192	4	788	Galschiot, who was also refused entry to the city ahead of the Beijing Olympics last year, had planned to join the annual June 4 vigil to mark the anniversary of the crackdown. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0192	5	974	In Copenhagen, the sculptor told AFP he thought his being turned back from Hong Kong was retaliation by China for the visit by Tibet's exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama in Denmark. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0192	6	1169	"I was supposed to exhibit two bronze sculptures in Hong Kong in remembrance of the 20th anniversary of the bloodly crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square," he said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0192	8	1546	He says the only reason he was given for being denied entry to Hong Kong -- although his two sons and a filmmaker with him were allowed into the former British colony -- was "questions of immigration". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0192	9	1757	"This denying me entry without valid reasons shows that Hong Kong, which has a particular status within China and larger freedom, obeys orders from Beijing," he said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0195	1	180	Big Ben, arguably the world's most famous clock which towers over London, marked its 150th anniversary Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0195	2	300	The clock started ticking on May 31 1859 and has continued with only occasional interruptions for maintenance, bad weather and even bird strikes ever since. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0195	3	466	The clock, housed in St Stephen's Tower which adjoins Britain's House of Commons, is one of the capital's most popular tourist attractions and boasts some amazing statistics. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0195	4	650	Each of the four Gothic clock faces is seven metres wide, with a minute hand over four metres long which travels the equivalent of 190 kilometres per year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0195	5	815	A Latin inscription is carved beneath each one -- "Domine salvam fac Reginam nostrum Victoriam primam" which means: "O Lord, save our Queen Victoria the First." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0195	6	976	Queen Victoria was on the throne in Britain at the time. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0195	7	1042	The 96 metre-high tower which houses the clock was built as part of the rebuilding of the Houses of Parliament by architects Charles Barry and Augustus Pugin following a major fire in 1843. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0195	8	1241	A competition was opened in 1846 to decide who should build the clock, but it took seven years to decide a winner.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0195	10	1580	The clock cost 2,500 pounds to build and was completed in 1854 but it was not installed until the clock tower was finished five years later. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0195	11	1730	Even then, there was a last-minute hitch -- the original cast-iron minute hands were too heavy and had to be replaced with copper ones.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0197	2	391	Companies chosen by the regional government will pump oil from two Kurdish fields via an Iraqi pipeline to Turkey with the consent of Baghdad in a step that could pave the way to ending bitter domestic feuds over Iraq's oil wealth. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0197	3	632	Initial exports will be around 40,000 barrels per day from the Taq Taq field in the province of Arbil and another 50,000 bpd from the Tawke field in Dohuk, company officials told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0197	4	825	"Piping of the oil will start Monday morning from the Taq Taq field, pumping it from seven wells," said Mohammed Okotan, director of the Taq Taq project for Turkey's Genel Enerji, which is partnered with Calgary-based Addax Petroleum.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0197	20	3439	Iraq wants pump six million barrels per day, up from its current stated output of around 2.2 million, within the next four to five years as new projects come online.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	0	58	Breakaway South Ossetia votes for parliament 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	1	189	The rebel Georgian region of South Ossetia voted Sunday in polls expected to secure the grip of its separatist leader nine months after it was the subject of war between Russia and Georgia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	2	388	The local opposition says Eduard Kokoity is seeking to use the elections to forge a loyal parliamentary majority to push through an amendment allowing him to run again for office when his second term lapses in 2011. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	3	613	Officials estimated the voter turnout at over 70 percent by 4:00 pm (1300 GMT). 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	4	693	According to law, the vote is deemed valid if the voter turnout reached 50 percent plus one vote. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	5	800	Voting was due to end at 1600 GMT, with the first results expected two hours later. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	6	893	Russia -- which outraged the West by recognising South Ossetia as independent in the wake of the August war with Georgia --- has said South Ossetia should not amend the existing term limits in its constitution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	7	1113	Kokoity said, however, it was too early to say whether he planned to run again, although he did not rule out that possibility. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	8	1249	"There are two and half years left till then and a lot left to do. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	9	1316	We are working and working now. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	10	1348	I am not thinking about it yet," he said in an interview with AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	11	1424	"With what happened in August we need three to four years to rebuild," Kokoity said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	12	1518	Four parties are competing for the 34 seats in the parliament, but the central election commission has barred the only two parties not loyal to Kokoity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	13	1680	Opposition activities said voting would not make a difference. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	14	1743	"I plan to sit at home. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	15	1767	There's nothing we can do," said Alan Gassiyev, an opposition leader, calling the polls "completely illegal." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	16	1886	Critics accuse Kokoity, an ex-wrestling champion, of muzzling opponents and stealing the money sent from Russia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	17	2008	As the reconstruction in the province stalled this winter, the opposition also accuses the separatist leader and his circle of diverting lorries carrying construction material and humanitarian aid to traffic the goods in Russia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	18	2246	But despite the slow pace of reconstruction in the republic many praise Kokoity for his leadership during the August conflict. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	19	2382	"Kokoity has done a lot for the people of South Ossetia, he's fought 20 years for this country," Angela Tedeyeva, a 32-year-old kindergarden teacher, said as she cast her ballot. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	20	2570	"If people are happy with him, they will vote for him again," she said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	21	2651	Georgia ridiculed the vote, with the country's reintegration minister Temur Iakobashvili saying the elections were "nothing but clownery, a farce and a redistribution of a criminal power." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	22	2849	Kokoity insists the elections were in strict accordance with law, saying the polls were "a maturity test for the small independent state." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	23	2997	He said the large number of voters at the polling stations was proof that the vote was deemed "genuine" by people. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	24	3121	Eighty-eight polling stations have been set up for the region's 50,000 residents as well as additional sites in Russia for expatriates and refugees from the fighting. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	25	3297	Kokoity's critics are concerned that the high number of polling stations placed in the villages which were used to be populated by ethnic Georgians and which are now nearly empty will be used to falsify the election results. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	26	3531	Kokoity -- who built connections in Moscow working as a trade official for the rebel region when it was known as a highway for smuggling in the early 1990s -- has rejected accusations against him as Georgian propaganda. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	27	3760	But as the looming political scandal in the region threatens to become an embarrassment for Moscow, there are signs that the Kremlin is scaling back its support for the South Ossetian leader. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	28	3961	Sergey Naryshkin, the head of the Russian presidential administration, said on Russian television this month that South Ossetia should not mend the existing term limits in its constitution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	29	4160	Moscow and Tbilisi fought a brief but intense war last August over the region, which had enjoyed de facto independence since the early 1990s thanks to tacit Russian support. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0198	30	4343	Following the conflict Russia formally recognised the region as independent, a move followed only by Nicaragua. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	0	58	Troops hunt Taliban as Pakistan says victory near 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	1	193	Pakistan's defence secretary said Sunday that a month-long offensive to crush Taliban fighters in northwest Swat could end within days, as fierce fighting spilled into a nearby tribal area. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	2	392	Swat valley's main town Mingora is back in government hands, the military announced late Saturday, and security officials said they were pursuing the leadership of the hardline Taliban movement into the nearby mountains. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	3	622	Secretary of Defence Syed Athar Ali told a security forum in Singapore that three targeted northwest districts were almost clear of Taliban rebels. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	4	779	"Operations in Swat, Buner and adjoining areas have almost met complete success," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	5	879	"Only five to ten percent of the job is remaining and hopefully within the next two to three days these pockets of resistance will be cleared." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	6	1032	However, chief military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas told AFP that it was impossible to estimate when the offensive would end. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	7	1175	"The operation is continuing in all of the areas and at this stage we cannot give any timeframe," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	8	1291	The army remains locked in battle in some areas, but the fall of Mingora was a critical milestone in an offensive launched after the Taliban thrust to within 100 kilometres (60 miles) of Islamabad in April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	9	1507	Pakistan's military also reported that 25 militants and seven soldiers were killed in clashes in South Waziristan near the Afghan border, a bolt-hole for Taliban and Al-Qaeda-linked militants south of the current army bombardment. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	10	1747	"Miscreants attacked a security forces checkpost last night (Saturday) in Spinkai Raghzai, South Waziristan agency. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	11	1863	The attack was repulsed successfully, inflicting heavy casualties on militants," it said in a statement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	12	1977	Fifteen militants and three soldiers died in the clash in Spinkai Raghzai, while elsewhere, in the semi-autonomous tribal area 10, insurgents and four troops including a lieutenant died when rebels attacked a military convoy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	13	2212	Civilians have started fleeing the area fearing a fresh military onslaught, but the army has denied an imminent assault on Waziristan, where militants branded by Washington as the greatest terror threat to the West are holed up. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	14	2450	The United States, which is firmly backing the current military drive, had warned that the rebels threatened Pakistan's very existence. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	15	2595	Officials have said that lower-ranking Taliban leaders had been killed but it was harder to get to the top leaders, who had a network of hardcore militants around them and had slipped into the rugged mountain terrain. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	16	2822	"They will be eliminated wherever we find them," said one military official, who did not wish to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media."
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	17	2976	We believe that they are somewhere in the mountains," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	18	3049	Pakistan has slapped a 600,000-dollar price on the head of firebrand Swat Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah for masterminding the nearly two-year uprising in the valley to enforce sharia law. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	19	3252	The government has also offered rewards for 21 rebel chiefs -- wanted dead or alive -- from Swat. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	20	3350	The military claims to have killed 1,244 militants since the offensive began, although the numbers are impossible to verify. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	21	3484	As the government steps up its campaign to stamp out the militants, fears are growing of a wave of revenge attacks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	22	3609	The northwestern capital Peshawar and the eastern cultural centre of Lahore have both been rocked by deadly explosions in the last five days, killing a total of 39 people and wounding hundreds more. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	23	3817	A spokesman for Pakistan Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud has claimed Wednesday's suicide bombing on a police building in Lahore, and warned of more "massive attacks" to avenge the Swat military operation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	24	4030	Nearly 2.4 million people have fled the current offensive, and the military relaxed a curfew Sunday in most parts of the northwest including Mingora to allow people trapped on the roads to return home or leave the region. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	25	4261	Senior Red Cross officials said Sunday they were "gravely concerned" over the situation in Swat Valley. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	26	4374	"The people of Swat need greater humanitarian protection and assistance immediately," said Pascal Cuttat, head of the organization's delegation in Pakistan, in a statement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	27	4556	Also Sunday, Taliban militants attacked a school in Hangu town south of Peshawar, killing one administrator and kidnapping three other people, local policeman Shoukat Hussain said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0199	28	4746	And in North Waziristan, suspected militants killed a former government doctor and an Afghan national, officials said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0201	1	198	More than 100 people rallied in Singapore late Sunday as part of a regional effort by civil rights groups to press Myanmar's military rulers to release democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0201	2	392	The yellow-clad demonstrators observed a minute of silence and released yellow balloons bearing good wishes for the pro-democracy leader during their gathering at a park designated as Singapore's free-speech corner. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0201	3	617	Similar rallies were also held simultaneously in Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Cambodia and Thailand, organisers said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0201	4	753	Aung San Suu Kyi has spent 13 of the last 19 years in detention, mostly at her crumbling lakeside mansion after the junta refused to honour elections won by her political party in 1990. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0201	5	948	The Nobel Peace Prize winner was moved to Yangon's notorious Insein prison and charged on May 14 for allegedly breaching the terms of her house arrest after John Yettaw, 53-year-old Mormon and former US military veteran, swam to her home and stayed there for two nights. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0201	6	1228	On Sunday, Myanmar's deputy defence minister Major General Aye Myint told a regional security forum in Singapore that Aung San Suu Kyi had "covered up" the truth by failing to report Yettaw’s visit. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0201	7	1436	Braema Mathi, one of the organisers of the rally, slammed the Myanmar official's comments. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0201	8	1536	"It’s devastating that they are alluding to this collusion between her and Yettaw. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0201	9	1619	They need to look at their own security lapses," Mathi told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0201	10	1693	"It is my hope that this event will be the beginning of concerted efforts by the people of ASEAN to write to their governments and lobby for her release," she said, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0201	11	1924	Wunna, a Myanmar citizen working in Singapore, said the Myanmar junta was "trying to find an excuse" to continue detaining Aung San Suu Kyi.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	0	58	Israel fumes over US settlement demands 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	1	174	Israel refused on Sunday to bow to US calls for a freeze of all settlement activity in the occupied West Bank, as it fumed over the "unfair" demands that have raised tensions between the key allies. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	2	382	"I want to say in a crystal clear manner that the current Israeli government will not accept in any fashion that legal settlement activity be frozen," said Transport Minister Yisrael Katz, a close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	3	631	The premier also held firm on Israel's controversial blockade of Hamas-run Gaza Strip, warning that the Islamists were rearming and that the ceasefire that ended a 22-day war on January 18 remained very fragile. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	4	852	Netanyahu did not himself address the settlements issue during the weekly cabinet meeting, but Katz's fighting words were echoed by other members of the largely right-wing cabinet, including from its most liberal party, Labour. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	5	1089	A senior Israeli official complained that Washington under President Barack Obama -- who has vowed to pursue Middle East peace talks as part of a changed approach to the region -- was placing unfair demands on the Jewish state. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	6	1326	"The Americans have demanded almost nothing from the Palestinians but are asking Israel to take steps that are a real sacrifice. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	7	1455	These demands are unfair," he told AFP on condition of anonymity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	8	1530	"The Palestinians are taking a passive approach. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	9	1579	They're not even ready to meet the Israeli side and Abu Mazen (Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas) wants the Americans to do all the work," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	10	1737	Abbas, who met Obama last week 10 days after the US president met Netanyahu, has vowed that that he will not resume talks unless Israel freezes settlements in the occupied West Bank. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	11	1929	The Obama administration has demanded that Israel stop all its activity in the settlements, including so-called natural growth construction that allows for building to accommodate a rising population. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	12	2139	The unusually blunt talk over one of the top stumbling points in the stalled Middle East peace process has raised alarm bells that the new US president could put pressure on Israel as part of his new approach to the Muslim world. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	13	2378	"This is an unjustifiable demand that the government and the public do not accept," said Interior Minister Eli Yishai of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	14	2539	Social Affairs Minister Isaac Herzog of the centre-left Labour party, the most liberal in Netanyahu's government, said that "one has to understand that there are various statuses within the settlements" and "saying that the picture is black and white or write or wrong is wrong." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	15	2828	More than 280,000 Israelis live in settlements dotted throughout the West Bank, which Israel captured in the 1967 war. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	16	2956	Although the international community considers all settlements to be illegal, Israel makes a distinction between those built with the state's blessing and outposts constructed without authorisation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	17	3164	Netanyahu has said he would dismantle outposts, but that it made "no sense" to ask for a complete freeze of construction. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	18	3295	Israeli officials have also complained that Obama's administration has yet to say it will honour commitments in a letter that then US president George W. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	19	3449	Bush sent to then Israeli premier Ariel Sharon in 2004. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	20	3514	Bush said that given the existence of major settlement blocs in the West Bank it was "unrealistic" to expect Israel to fully withdraw from the territory as part of a final peace deal. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	21	3707	Aside from the settlements, there is stark disagreement between Washington and Israel over creating a Palestinian state, with Obama repeatedly saying he was committed to the principle and Netanyahu so far refusing to endorse it in public. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	22	3955	Obama is due in Saudi Arabia and Egypt this week in a bid to reach out to Muslims and end the deep mistrust of the United States felt across much of the Islamic world. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0202	23	4132	Netanyahu on Sunday also held firm on maintaining the blockade of Gaza, saying that "we do not want to strengthen Hamas" by allowing the Islamist group to rebuild its defences. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	0	58	Israeli FM to Russia, Belarus 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	1	164	Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman leaves for his first official visits to Russia and Belarus on Monday to discuss Iran and bilateral issues, his ministry said in a statement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	2	357	In Moscow, Lieberman, a Russian-speaking Soviet emigrant, will meet Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, counterpart Sergei Lavrov and heads of the Jewish community. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	3	561	He will discuss "political developments and regional threats with his hosts" as well as bilateral relations, said the statement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	4	699	Topping the agenda for the visit is the issue of Iran's controversial nuclear programme, a "severe geopolitical threat to Israel and the entire region," it said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	5	870	Russia is helping build the first nuclear reactor in the Islamic Republic, which Israel considers its arch-enemy after repeated statements by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad calling for the Jewish state to be "wiped off the map." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	6	1107	Widely considered to be the Middle East's sole if undeclared nuclear power, Israel along with main ally Washington suspects Iran of trying to develop atomic weapons under the guise of a civilian nuclear programme, a charge Tehran has repeatedly denied. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	7	1369	Moscow is seeking a greater role in the Middle East and a Russian foreign ministry spokesman said on Friday that Russia hopes Lieberman's visit will boost the country's hopes of hosting a Middle East peace conference this year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	8	1606	The statement from Lieberman's ministry made no mention of the conference idea but Israel has so far been unenthusiastic. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	9	1737	Israel is unhappy about Russia's contacts with the Islamist Hamas movement ruling the Gaza Strip, an Iranian-backed group pledged to the destruction of the Jewish state. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	10	1916	Russia is the only member of the Quartet -- the European Union, the United Nations and the United States -- to be formally on speaking terms with Hamas, classified as a terrorist group by the EU, Israel and the US. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0203	11	2140	During his trip to Damascus a week ago, Lavrov met with Hamas supremo Khaled Meshaal, telling the Vesti-24 channel later that "we felt a more realistic assessment of the situation" following the talks with the exiled leader.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	1	194	Andy Murray reached his first French Open quarter-final on Sunday where he will face big-hitting Fernando Gonazalez who almost missed Roland Garros due to freak injury caused by signing autographs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	2	401	Third seed Murray became only the third British man in the Open era to reach the last eight here with a convincing 7-5, 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 win over Croatia's Marin Cilic. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	3	577	The ever-improving 22-year-old, with former two-time Roland Garros finalist Alex Corretja helping hone his claycourt game, looked in impressive physical condition with a series of long, punishing rallies eventually telling on the 13th seeded Cilic, the youngest man left in the draw. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	4	870	Cilic, who came into the fourth round having lost the fewest number of games of any player in the last 16, was wilting by the time he slipped 0-3 down in the third set. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	5	1048	He needed treatment on his left leg after falling awkwardly before Murray went on to secure a convincing victory in the seventh game. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	6	1191	Chilean 13th seed Gonzalez revealed how an injury signing autographs almost shattered his French Open dreams. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	7	1310	The 28-year-old, who outgunned Romania's Victor Hanescu 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 to reach the Roland Garros quarter-finals for the third time, injured his ankle while signing photos and tennis balls for fans at the Rome Masters in April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	8	1546	As a result, he spent a month on the sidelines. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	9	1603	"I was signing autographs and someone called me from the other side of the court and when I ran over to them, I twisted my ankle," said Gonzalez. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	10	1758	"I think I only managed to sign two and then I had to go back to the locker room because my ankle was so painful." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	11	1882	The freak accident meant Gonzalez had to skip the rest of the claycourt season to recover in time for the French Open. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	12	2010	But despite the Rome scare, he believes he is now playing some of the best tennis of his 10-year career. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	13	2124	"I think on average I am playing my best," said Gonzalez who made the semi- finals in Rome where he was defeated by Rafael Nadal before being completely finished off by his injury. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	14	2314	"I have played at a good level almost in every match. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	15	2368	I enjoy going onto the courts and into practice although as I am getting older I tend to practice less but with more intensity." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	16	2506	Later Sunday, defending champion and top seed Rafael Nadal tackles Sweden's Robin Soderling for a place in the last eight.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0204	18	2719	In the day's other last 16 tie, Russian 10th seed Nikolay Davydenko, twice a semi-finalist, faces Spanish eighth seed Fernando Verdasco who is looking for a first quarter-final place.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0206	1	184	US President Barack Obama may meet with Pope Benedict XVI in July when he is in Italy for a Group of Eight summit, the ANSA news agency reported Sunday, without citing its sources. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0206	2	374	It would most likely take place as the G8 leaders wrap up their July 8-10 summit to be held in L'Aquila, the Italian town devastated by an earthquake in April that killed some 299 people, the agency said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0213	1	194	Cuba has agreed to resume talks with the United States on migration and direct mail, a US official said here Sunday, as tense ties continue to thaw under President Barack Obama's administration. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0213	2	398	The announcement came as US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton prepared to travel to the Organization of American States general assembly in Honduras, where Washington and its southern neighbors are caught in a row over the pace of normalization with Cuba. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0213	3	664	The Cuban government informed Washington on Saturday that it "would like to resume migration talks....

AFP_ENG_20090531.0213	9	1415	The official said the Cubans "also indicated they would like to explore areas of additional dialogue," such as in the area of counternarcotics, counter terrorism, hurricane and disaster preparedness response.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0214	1	180	Andy Murray became only the third British man in the Open era to reach the quarter-finals of Roland Garros on Sunday with a 7-5, 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 win over Croatia's Marin Cilic. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0214	2	365	The third-seeded Briton will now tackle three-time quarter-finalist Fernando Gonzalez, the Chilean 12th seed, for a place in the semi-finals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0214	3	516	Ever-improving Murray, 22, has now won four successive matches on clay for the first time in his career and he looked impressive on Sunday with his physical fitness proving crucial in a tie of long, punishing rallies. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0214	4	743	He broke Cilic, whom he had beaten twice in their two previous meetings, in the opening game and although the tall Croatian hit back immediately, Murray nipped ahead again in the 11th game on his way to taking the opener 7-5. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0214	5	978	Breaks were traded again in the seventh and eighth games of the second before Murray's greater experience told in the tiebreak. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0214	6	1115	Murray was soon a break to the good in the third set against the 20-year-old Cilic, the youngest player left in the men's draw, whose miserable afternoon got worse when he needed treatment to his left leg at 0-3 after falling awkwardly. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0214	7	1361	The Scotsman, with a claycourt game honed by the help of former two-time French Open runner-up Alex Corretja, was soon 4-0 ahead over the wilting Croatian. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0214	8	1526	Cilic, who came into the fourth round having lost the fewest number of games of any player in the last 16, pulled one break back, surrendered it to trail 1-5 before Murray secured a convincing victory in the seventh game.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	0	58	Europe's desperate bid to bring out voters 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	1	176	European leaders on Sunday stepped up a desperate battle to persuade people to vote for the EU parliament this week, but the campaign has opened up new political divisions across the continent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	2	379	With polls indicating a record low turnout for the June 4-7 election, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a joint plea to voters, saying a strong parliament was essential to confront the economic crisis. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	3	632	The two leaders said they want "a strong Europe that protects" its people and called for "all Europeans to vote" in the statement, published by the Journal du Dimanche newspaper in France and Die Welt am Sonntag in Germany. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	4	865	A "strong Europe does not necessarily mean more powers for the European Union, even more European legislation or even more financial means," said Merkel and Sarkozy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	5	1040	First steps "to assure real European regulation in the financial sector, based on coordination and cooperation between regulators" should be taken at the next EU summit in June, they said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	6	1238	"For speculative funds, tax havens, payment for executives and financial traders, we want an exemplary Europe," they added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	7	1371	The pair also gave strong backing to the Lisbon reform treaty, intended to streamline EU decision-making but deadlocked by Ireland's rejection in a referendum last year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	8	1550	"Europe must play a leading role in the world. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	9	1597	For that, it must have efficient institutions. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	10	1644	That is why we need the Lisbon Treaty," they said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	11	1704	Merkel and Sarkozy also reaffirmed opposition to Turkey joining the EU, without naming the country. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	12	1804	"To be able to act, the EU needs frontiers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	13	1848	Unlimited enlargement is not possible." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	14	1897	The joint statement highlighted fears that the vote for the 736 member European assembly could prove a new embarrassment for the 27-nation European Union, after a record 45 percent abstention at the last election in 2004. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	15	2128	In France, a poll for the Le Parisien newspaper Sunday suggested that 55 percent of the nation's would not bother going to the polls. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	16	2262	In Britain, Poland and Romania, fewer than one in three plan to vote, according to recent surveys. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	17	2370	In Spain, which has benefited enormously from EU development funds, political analysts expect turnout of 40 percent at best. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	18	2495	Portugal expects a record abstention rate. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	19	2547	The stakes are higher now, however, as the European Parliament -- the only directly elected EU institution -- will have a bigger voice in decisions that affect 500 million Europeans if the Lisbon treaty comes into force. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	20	2777	"A lot of voters don't understand what the European Parliament does," said Philip White, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform think- tank in London. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	21	2955	"You're not voting to keep a government in office or kick it out. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	22	3021	The stakes can seem a little bit less clear than they are in national elections." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	23	3112	But in many countries the EU vote will be a test of the national governments in power, with far-right and left-wing parties expected to benefit from protest votes and low turnouts in some member states. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	24	3324	In Britain, where euroscepticism runs deep, the governing Labour Party is expected to garner only 16 to 17 percent of the vote, putting it in third place against the rival Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, weekend polls in the Times and Sunday Telegraph suggested. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	25	3601	Turnout at European elections in Britain is usually low -- in the last polls in 2004, it was just 38 percent, and this time, fringe parties like the anti-EU UK Independence Party and the far-right British National Party are expected to benefit. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0216	26	3855	An Economist magazine/YouGov poll last week found that only 31 percent of Britons think its membership of the European Union is a good thing, compared to 37 percent who think it is bad.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0217	1	167	Italy's already treacherous tour to Australia and New Zealand has been hit by the withdrawals of experienced prop Martin Castrogiovanni, scrum-half Simon Picone and full-back Andrea Marcato. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0217	2	367	Leicester Tiger Castrogiovanni and Marcato are injured while Picone misses out due to "personal reasons" according to the Italian Rugby Federation (FIR) on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0217	3	540	The absences will hit a squad that is already without full-back Andrea Masi and hooker Carlo Festuccia as the Metro Racing pair are from the Abruzzo region that was badly hit by an earthquake in April and they have decided to stay with their families. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0217	4	801	Worse still for English-born South African-raised coach Nick Mallett is that Castrogiovanni is a first choice prop while Picone would likely have started at number nine.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0220	1	204	Ailing English football giants Newcastle were put back on the market by owner Mike Ashley on Sunday at a vastly lower price than he bought them. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0220	2	358	The 46-year-old businessman is reported by the BBC to be willing to sell the club for only 80million pounds as opposed to the 135million he paid in 2006. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0220	3	521	Ashley, a Londoner who has tried to conjure up favour with the Newcastle fans by wearing Newcastle team shirts and drinking pints of beer among the spectators, confessed to the Sunday Times that he couldn't wait to leave. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0220	4	752	"It's been catastrophic for everybody.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0220	8	981	Ashley, who went through four managers in the past campaign, again issued a fulsome apology to the longsuffering Newcastle fans. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0220	9	1119	"I never said I was an expert in football clubs," Ashley added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0220	10	1192	"I was just a fan - although a very wealthy fan, but I'm not so wealthy now. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0220	11	1278	"I put my money into it and I tried my best, but I accept my best was woefully short.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0220	16	1883	While Ashley is yet to sell the club one of his last acts might be to sign Newcastle icon Alan Shearer up to a four year contract as manager - though he only managed one win in his eight matches in charge.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0228	2	345	The 20-year-old missed the plane to South Africa so that he could receive intensive physiotherapy at his club to remedy a troublesome thigh strain. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0228	3	502	He was ordered to work with the Blues medical team to try and overcome the problem that first ruled him out of his club’s Celtic League clash with Munster prior to the tour.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0232	4	700	In a dramatic race that began in wet conditions, Stoner seized the advantage when switching bikes after 10 laps for a change of tyres. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0232	5	844	He was the fastest man on the track by some margin in those first few laps after the switch and although Yamaha pair Lorenzo and Rossi were quickest at the end, they had both lost too much time and too many places to hit back. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0232	6	1080	Stoner completed the 23 laps in 45min 41.894sec to win by just over a second to Spaniard Lorenzo. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0232	7	1187	In an exciting race the pole-sitter got off to a terrible start in the wet and immediately dropped to eighth. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0232	8	1306	Quickest off the mark were Australian Chris Vermeulen, who started 11th, and Andrea Dovizioso, who began seventh but Stoner passed them both on the long straight at the beginning of the second lap. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0232	9	1513	Vermeulen quickly started heading backwards, eventually finishing 10th, as Rossi started to move up from fifth.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0232	12	1890	However, on the 10th lap all the front runners came into the pits for a change of bikes and when they came out, Stoner was quickest to find his pace. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0232	13	2049	Melandri immediately started heading backwards, eventually finishing 11th and 35sec back, while Loris Capirossi propelled himself into race contention with Stoner and Dovizioso. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0232	14	2236	Lorenzo and Rossi initially struggled with their bikes down in fifth and sixth and the time they lost over those first three laps coming out of the pits, essentially cost either of them a chance of victory. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0232	15	2452	While Stoner had soon taken the race lead, both Yamaha riders had to then pass Melandri, Capirossi and Dovizioso and by the time they had done so, Stoner was over a second ahead and with only a couple of laps remaining.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0246	16	2423	Gonzalez, whose best Grand Slam performance remains his runner-up spot to Federer at the 2007 Australian Open, broke through again in the seventh game to stretch to 5-2. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0246	17	2602	The 1998 Roland Garros junior champion then wrapped up the tie with his 50th winner to finish off Hanescu after only 87 minutes.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0247	1	178	Germany have tentatively organised friendly internationals with Chile and Egypt on November 14 and 18, general manager Oliver Bierhoff told the SID sports agency on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0247	2	360	The matches are dependent on Germany landing first place in their World Cup qualifying Group 4, Bierhoff explained. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0247	3	485	Currently, they lead Russia by four points with five wins and a draw in six matches, but the latter have a game in hand, while Finland are well adrift in third place five points further back. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0247	4	686	Three-time winners Germany are already well advanced with preparations for the finals and intend to have three friendlies in Africa before heading for the finals in South Africa, assuming they qualify. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0247	5	897	The Germans are tipped to set up their headquarters in Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0247	6	1008	"Everyone is talking of Cape Town and its region but we would have optimum facilities in Gauteng - winter is drier there, altitude is 1600 metres and that's important as most matches will be played at that altitude," said Bierhoff.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0248	1	180	Fifteen Indonesians were killed Sunday when an inter-city bus lost control due to a brake failure on Sumatra island, police said, adding that the death toll may rise. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0248	2	356	The bus was carrying 37 people when it tried to overtake two cars in front of it on a narrow ascending road, police official Ardiyanto told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0248	3	510	One of the cars stopped abruptly and the bus, due to a brake failure, slid down into a ravine, he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0248	4	623	"The number of casualties may rise as there are ten passengers that are badly injured," he said, adding that the accident took place at 2pm (0700GMT) in the Lembah Anai area of Padang Panjang city in West Sumatra province. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0248	5	855	Fatal road accidents are common on Indonesia's poorly maintained roads. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0249	0	58	Israel softens controversial Naqba bill 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0249	1	174	The Israeli cabinet on Sunday softened a much-criticized bill on the Naqba, what many Palestinians lament as the  "catastrophe" of the 1948 creation of Israel. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0249	2	343	The revised draft law now prohibits any government funds from being used for events marking the Naqba, instead of banning commemorations altogether, a government official said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0249	3	529	"The original bill marked a serious infringement on the freedom of expression, which we deemed excessive," the official said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0249	4	664	The changes followed a legal review of the bill approved by the cabinet last week, which would have prohibited any events marking Naqba and provided for penalties of up to three years in prison. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0249	5	868	In the week following the bill's submission by Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman's ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party, the draft was attacked by both Arab MPs and rights groups. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0249	6	1061	The bill must still pass three votes by parliament to become law. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0249	7	1136	A government committee also on Sunday scrapped another Yisrael Beitenu draft law, which would have required Israelis to take an oath of loyalty and which mainly targeted Israel's Arab minority. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0249	8	1339	Israeli Arabs and the extent of their loyalty to the Jewish state was the top campaign theme of the secular Yisrael Beitenu, which came in third in the February election, winning 15 of parliament's 120 seats. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0249	9	1557	The Israeli Arab community comprises around 1.2 million people, out of a total population of about seven million.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0250	1	176	CSKA Moscow won the Russian Cup, beating holders Kazan 1-0 at Khimki stadium on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0250	2	273	Russian international midfielder Yevgeny Aldonin was the hero, scoring the only goal of the match with a 22-metre screamer in the third minute of injury time for the Red Army side's fifth national cup win in the post-Soviet era. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0250	3	511	CSKA had to cope with being a man down from the 14th minute when their midfielder Pavel Mamayev was sent off for fouling Kazan's Argentinian striker Alexandro Dominguez. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	0	58	Taiwan's opposition pushes for China trade referendum 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	1	185	Taiwan's pro-independence opposition on Sunday renewed its pledge to hold a referendum aimed at stopping the Beijing-friendly administration from signing a comprehensive trade pact with China. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	2	387	The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said it hopes to collect at least 80,000 signatures before the end of August in the first part of a two-step process required by law for the campaign, announced last month, to go ahead. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	3	621	Once it reaches its target figure, the party will then have to enlist the endorsements of up to one million supporters before a referendum can take place. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	4	785	"Concerns are mounting about signing an ECFA (Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement) with China as it is not a pure trade agreement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	5	921	Rather it has something to do with sovereignty," DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	6	1015	"People here are entitled to decide if Taiwan people, through a referendum, approve such an agreement with China," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	7	1148	The Ma Ying-jeou administration is targeting the pact -- similar in scope to a free trade agreement -- with Beijing to boost the flow of goods and personnel across the Strait and to help the island tackle recession. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	8	1373	Chinese President Hu Jintao told visiting Wu Poh-hsiung, chairman of the Kuomintang, in Beijing last week that talks on the ECFA were likely to start in the second half of the year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	9	1564	Hu said the mainland would like to see an economic agreement that will benefit economic development on both sides and improve people's welfare,  according to the Xinhua news agency. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	10	1755	Taiwan's Economic Minister Yiin Chii-ming had defended the trade pact, claiming that the island's economy could rise by 1.4 percentage points by forging an economic pact with China. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	11	1946	In particular, the petrochemical sector, machinery and auto components makers are expected to benefit from closer cross-strait ties, Yiin said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	12	2099	But the DPP has strongly opposed the potential pact, which it claims would demote Taipei to the status of local government in any rapprochement talks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0251	13	2259	China still regards Taiwan as part of its territory awaiting reunification by force if necessary, although the two sides have been governed separately since the end of a civil war in 1949.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0253	1	182	Former Germany star Lothar Matthaus, currently in charge at Israel's Maccabi Netanya, is mulling a switch back to Germany to Fortuna Dusseldorf, media reports in his homeland quoted him Sunday as saying. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0253	2	395	"There is much to do at Dusseldorf, the club should be in the top flight and that has to be the goal," Matthaus, 48, told Bild newspaper. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0253	3	542	Dusseldorf have a long history and were champions in 1933 while they have also won the German Cup twice - but they have just been promoted to the second division after a decade in the third. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0253	4	742	Businessman Daniel Jammer, who already owns Maccabi Netanya and is close to Matthaus, is reputedly interested in investing in the outfit and told Bild he saw Matthaus in the role of sporting director. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0253	5	952	Matthaus described the possibility as potentially "a very interesting mission." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0253	6	1041	To date, Matthaus, who won a host of honours with Bayern Munich and led Germany to the 1990 World Cup, has coached in several countries but has yet really to make a name for himself in the role.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	1	179	Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia underlined her growing potential on Sunday by brushing aside Agnes Szavay of Hungary 6-2, 6-4 to reach the quarter-finals of the French Open. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	2	361	It is the first time that the 20-year-old from Bratislava has made it through to the last eight of a Grand Slam event at her eighth attempt. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	3	511	"It was difficult because we were both nervous at the beginning and it was a case of not making mistakes," she said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	4	637	"But I prepared well for this game and knew how she would play." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	5	711	One of the smallest players on the WTA circuit at just 1.61 metres, Cibulkova had failed to take a set of Szavay in their three previous encounters, but she was quickly out of the blocks this time breaking serve twice for a 4-0 lead. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	6	954	Szavay, who stunned Venus Williams in the third round, steadied the ship in the fifth game but by that time the first set was out of her reach, Cibulkova taking it 6-2 in 38 minutes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	7	1146	It was a different story at the start of the second half with Cibulkova tightening up and dropping serve to go 0-2 down, but she snatched one back in the next to level at 2-2. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	8	1331	The 20th seed then broke again in the fifth game keeping up a steady stream of baseline groundstrokes and allowing Szavay to make the errors as she sought a solution to her opponent's dominance of the rallies. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	9	1550	There looked to be no way back for the demoralised Hungarian as Cibulkova got to match point on her own serve at 5-2 ahead. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	10	1683	But a wild forehand let that slip away and she followed up with a double fault at break point to hand her opponent an unlikely lifeline. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	11	1829	Szavay staved off another match point on her own serve by coming into the net more often, but Cibulkova this time held steady on her own service game to set up a quarter-final tie against either former world No. 1 Maria Sharapova of Russia or Li Na of China. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	12	2097	"I have nothing to lose from now on in," the Slovak said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0254	13	2164	"I was injured before Roland Garros (leg muscle) and didn't play the big tournaments, so I was a bit afraid.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0256	1	176	Top seed Dinara Safina eased into the French Open quarter-finals on Sunday defeating Aravane Rezai of France 6-1, 6-0 in a 53-minute centre-court mismatch. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0256	2	341	It was the Russian's 18th win out of 19 matches on clay this season and confirmed her status as favourite to win her first Grand Slam title. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0256	3	491	Rezai, playing for just the second time in the fourth round of a Grand Slam tournament, started as a rank outsider, but she had the first glimpse of an opening with a break point in the third game. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0256	4	698	Safina though comfortably brushed that aside and then, helped by two double faults from her opponent, broke serve in the following game to lead 3-1. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0256	5	856	Safina, whose four games lost in her first three matches are the third least in all Grand Slams, then stepped on the accelerator to also take the next three games and the set in just 30 minutes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0256	6	1060	It was more of the same in the second set as Rezai seemed to be stage-struck on the Philippe Chatrier centre court against her much bigger and more physical opponent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0256	7	1236	Safina bagged an early break of serve and jumped out into a 4-0 lead from which there was no way back for the struggling Frenchwoman.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	1	193	Pakistan's defence secretary said Sunday that a month-long offensive to crush Taliban fighters in the northwest could end within days, as fierce fighting spilled into a nearby tribal area. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	2	391	Swat valley's main town Mingora is back in government hands, the military announced late Saturday, and security officials said they were now pursuing the top leadership of the hardline Taliban movement into the nearby mountains. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	3	629	Secretary of Defence Syed Athar Ali told a security forum in Singapore that three targeted northwest districts were almost clear of Taliban rebels. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	4	786	"Operations in Swat, Buner and adjoining areas have almost met complete success," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	5	886	"Only five to ten percent of the job is remaining and hopefully within the next two to three days these pockets of resistance will be cleared." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	6	1039	The army remains locked in battle in some areas, but the fall of Mingora was a critical milestone in an offensive launched after the Taliban thrust to within 100 kilometres (60 miles) of Islamabad in April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	7	1255	Pakistan's military also reported that 25 militants and seven soldiers were killed in clashes in South Waziristan near the Afghan border, a bolt-hole for Taliban and Al-Qaeda-linked militants south of the current army bombardment. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	8	1495	"Miscreants attacked a security forces checkpost last night (Saturday) in Spinkai Raghzai, South Waziristan agency. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	9	1611	The attack was repulsed successfully, inflicting heavy casualties on militants," it said in a statement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	10	1725	Fifteen militants and three soldiers died in the clash in Spinkai Raghzai, while elsewhere in the semi-autonomous tribal area 10 insurgents and four troops including a lieutenant died when rebels attacked a military convoy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	11	1958	Civilians have started fleeing the area fearing a fresh military onslaught, but the army has denied an imminent assault on Waziristan, where militants branded by Washington as the greatest terror threat to the West are holed up. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	12	2196	The United States, which is firmly backing the current military drive, had warned that the rebels threaten Pakistan's very existence. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	13	2339	Officials have said that lower-ranking Taliban leaders had been killed but it was harder to get to the top leaders, who had a network of hardcore militants around them and had slipped into the rugged mountain terrain. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	14	2566	"They will be eliminated wherever we find them," said one military official, who did not wish to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media, adding: "We believe that they are somewhere in the mountains." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	15	2792	Pakistan has slapped a 600,000-dollar price on the head of firebrand Swat Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah for masterminding the nearly two-year uprising in the valley to enforce sharia law. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	16	2995	Fazlullah led thousands of supporters in a campaign that has beheaded opponents, burned schools and fought government troops since November 2007. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	17	3150	The government has also offered rewards for 21 rebel chiefs -- wanted dead or alive -- from Swat. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0257	18	3248	The military claims to have killed 1,244 militants since the offensive began, although the numbers are impossible to verify.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	1	192	Six people were killed in a West Bank shoot-out on Sunday when an attempt to arrest a senior Hamas commander went awry, deepening the rift between the two main Palestinian factions. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	2	383	The Islamist Hamas movement ruling the Gaza Strip warned that the rival Fatah group loyal to president Mahmud Abbas had crossed a "red line" over the killing of one of its top fighters in the arrest operation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	3	602	The gunfight erupted when Palestinian police dominated by Fatah tried to arrest Mohammed al-Samman, the commander of Hamas's armed wing in the northern West Bank who was also on Israel's wanted list.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	7	1203	Hamas branded the incident a "red line" and said it laid "complete responsibility of this ugly crime on Abbas and his security forces." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	8	1348	Describing Abbas and his forces as agents of arch-enemy Israel, Hamas said in a statement that it would respond "with acts," without elaborating. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	9	1503	"There is no difference between the occupation who shoots and the people who carry out their missions for them," a spokesman for Hamas's armed wing said at a press conference in Gaza. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	10	1696	The deep-seated rivalries between Hamas and Fatah boiled over in June 2007 when the Islamists violently seized control of Gaza, causing a split in Palestinian ranks that has become a key stumbling block in efforts to reach Middle East peace. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	11	1947	Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhum said there was no chance of further reconciliation talks with Fatah after the "escalation by security services of Abu Mazen and Fatah against Hamas and its leaders in the West Bank." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	12	2168	"Fatah should choose -- dialogue with us or doing the dirty work of the Zionist enemy," Barhum said as Hamas decried the killing over mosque loudspeakers in Gaza City.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	19	2947	Damiri also said that during the arrest, police discovered Hamas leaflets containing "incitement against the Palestinian Authority and against the Palestinian security branches." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	20	3135	"We consider what happened today as very dangerous," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	21	3197	"It was an attempt to destroy any hope of resuming the (reconciliation) dialogue." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	22	3289	Abbas's power based has been limited to the occupied West Bank since Hamas booted his Fatah party out of the Gaza Strip, which remains under a crippling Israeli blockade. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0260	23	3469	The two factions held five rounds of talks under Egyptian mediation in an attempt to reconcile but to no avail and the two sides have frequently accused their rivals of campaigns of persecution.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0262	11	1658	His entry was unexpected because of China's sensitive attitude to any criticism of the crackdown. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0262	12	1765	Other 1989 campaigners have been refused entry to Hong Kong in the past, although it has a separate legal and immigration system from the mainland, including the right to protest. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0262	13	1954	"I was very surprised as I have tried many, many times to come," said Xiong, who arrived Saturday night, the first time he had set foot on Chinese soil in 17 years. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0262	14	2128	"I hope in the future I can not only go to Hong Kong, but also to Beijing," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0262	15	2223	The marchers gathered in the city's Victoria Park, waving banners with slogans such as "Pass the torch on, relay the message of democracy to those who come after us" and "Speak the truth, never forget." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0262	16	2435	The rally included a small group of mainland Chinese students, who wore T-shirts citing former Communist leader Mao Zedong: "Whoever suppresses student movements is going to have a bad ending."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0263	1	181	An Israeli government committee on Sunday rejected a bill tabled by the ultra- nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party that would have required Israelis to take an oath of loyalty, officials said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0263	2	381	The legislation committee scrapped the bill proposed by Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman's party by a vote of eight to three, an official told AFP.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0277	9	1629	Szavay staved off another match point on her own serve by coming into the net more often, but Cibulkova this time held steady on her own service game to set up a quarter-final tie against either former world No. 1 Maria Sharapova of Russia or Li Na of China. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0278	0	58	Football: New deal for Ballack 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0278	1	162	Chelsea's German midfielder Michael Ballack, only a substitute for Saturday's FA Cup final win over Everton, has agreed a one-year contract extension, the BBC reported on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0278	2	350	"I haven't signed yet but I have agreed for another year," Ballack, 32, said, adding he expected AC Milan's Carlo Ancelotti to succeed Guus Hiddink as coach next season at Stamford Bridge. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0278	3	548	"I haven't worked under him and I don't know him very well but you can see from the work he has done at Milan that he is a successful manager," Ballack told BBC Sport. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0278	4	725	"It's not done yet but it looks like he will be coach." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0278	5	790	Ancelotti is set to reveal if he is to take charge after the Serie A season ends Sunday evening as interim manager Hiddink, who replaced the sacked Luiz Felipe in February, returns to his job as Russia coach following four months in London. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0278	6	1040	Ballack, signed by Jose Mourinho in 2006, has seen Chelsea win two FA Cups since but insisted that next season he wants to target bigger prizes with Manchester United having dominated the English Premiership since his arrival in England. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0278	7	1287	"What we need at Chelsea is consistency," he insisted. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0278	8	1342	"There is not much that we need to change to win the Premier League next season. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0278	9	1423	We have a great team, which is the most important thing, but we have to change the manager again and we will need a bit of time to adapt. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0278	10	1570	"Every coach works with different methods and the players have to get to know him - hopefully we won't need too much time because if we do we will be a little bit behind," said Ballack, who indicated he did not think a new coach would need to go on a spending spree. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0278	11	1846	"I don't think we need to buy anybody because we already have a lot of good players on the bench. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0278	12	1953	"That is for the club to decide but, if you look at the performances over the last couple of years in reaching finals, we have a really good squad and are heading in the right direction."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0280	1	174	Croatians cast ballots on Sunday in a second round of local and regional elections, including a mayoral race in the capital Zagreb, which are expected to be influenced by the economic crisis. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0280	2	375	The elections are seen as a test of the ability of the Croatia's governing coalition to handle the effects of the global economic crisis, which sent the Adriatic country into recession late last year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0280	3	585	Some four million voters were eligible to elect 221 mayors and municipal heads. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0280	4	674	Polling stations opened at 0500 GMT and were to close 12 hours later. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0280	5	744	First results were expected later on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0280	6	798	At 0900 GMT, four hours after voting started, turnout was at 10.8 percent, the electoral commission said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0280	7	904	It was some three percent lower than in the first round voting held two weeks ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0280	8	996	In Zagreb, incumbent mayor Milan Bandic of the opposition Social Democrats (SDP) is being tipped to see off a challenge from independent candidate Josip Kregar and win a fourth mandate. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0280	9	1191	On May 17, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader's ruling conservative Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) was re-elected in most counties in the first round while the SDP asserted their control in major cities. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0280	10	1397	The HDZ and its coalition partners won seven prefect posts and held a majority in 14 out of 21 county assemblies. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0280	11	1511	The SDP got four county prefects and secured control of five county assemblies. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0280	12	1600	The conservatives lost the mayoral post in the country's second biggest town of Split, on the Adriatic coast, where an SDP candidate is to face an independent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0280	13	1769	Local analysts said the vote confirmed that the SDP and left bloc dominate in more developed parts of Croatia as well as in cities, while the HDZ and right- wing parties are more popular in less developed and rural areas. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0280	14	2000	The polls give voters the right for the first time to directly elect mayors, county prefects and municipal heads, along with 21 county assemblies and more than 550 city and town councils. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0280	15	2197	The HDZ, founded by late nationalist leader Franjo Tudjman, returned to power in 2003 after three years in opposition. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0280	16	2316	Sanader has since shaken off the HDZ's hardline nationalist legacy and transformed it into a party that is aiming to lead Croatia to becoming the European Union's 28th member by 2011. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0281	0	58	Israel fumes over US settlement demands 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0281	1	174	Israel refused on Sunday to bow to US calls for a freeze to all settlement activity in the occupied West Bank, as it fumed over the "unfair" demands that have raised tensions between the close allies. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0281	2	384	"I want to say in a crystal clear manner that the current Israeli government will not accept in any fashion that legal settlement activity be frozen," said Transport Minister Yisrael Katz, a close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0281	3	633	The premier himself did not address the issue at the opening of the weekly cabinet meeting but the fighting words were echoed by other members of the largely right-wing cabinet, including from its most liberal party, Labour. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0281	4	867	A senior Israeli official complained that Washington under President Barack Obama -- who has vowed to pursue Middle East peace talks as part of a changed approach to the region -- was placing unfair demands on its close ally. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0281	5	1102	"The Americans have demanded almost nothing from the Palestinians but are asking Israel to take steps that are a real sacrifice. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0281	6	1231	These demands are unfair," he told AFP on condition of anonymity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0281	7	1306	"The Palestinians are taking a passive approach. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0281	8	1355	They're not even ready to meet the Israeli side and Abu Mazen (Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas) wants the Americans to do all the work," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0281	9	1513	Abbas, who met Obama last week, 10 days after the US president met Netanyahu, has vowed that that he will not relaunch talks unless Israel freezes settlements in the occupied West Bank. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0281	10	1708	The Obama administration has demanded that Israel stop all its activity in the settlements, including the so-called natural growth construction that allows for building to accommodate a growing population. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0281	11	1923	The unusually blunt talk over one of the top stumbling points in the stalled Middle East peace process has raised alarm bells in Israel that the new US president could put pressure on the Jewish state as part of his new approach to the Muslim world. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0281	12	2182	"This is an unjustifiable demand that the government and the public do not accept," Interior Minister Eli Yishai of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0281	13	2338	Social Affairs Minister Isaac Herzog of the centre-left Labour party that is the most liberal in Netanyahu's government, said that "one has to understand that there are various statuses within the settlements" and "saying that the picture is black and white or write or wrong is wrong." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0281	14	2634	More than 280,000 Israelis live in settlements dotted throughout the West Bank, which Israel captured in war in 1967. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0281	15	2761	Although the international community considers all settlements illegal, Israel makes a distinction between those that were built with the state's blessing and outposts, those constructed without authorisation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0281	16	2980	Netanyahu has said he would dismantle outposts, but that it made "no sense" to ask for a complete freeze to construction. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0281	17	3111	Israeli officials have also complained that Obama's administration has yet to say it will honour commitments in a letter that then US president George W. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0281	18	3265	Bush sent to then Israeli premier Ariel Sharon in 2004. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0281	19	3330	Bush said that given the existence of major settlement blocs in the West Bank it was "unrealistic" to expect Israel to fully withdraw from the territory as part of a final peace deal. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0281	20	3523	"This administration has not yet recognised the arrangements made between the Israeli government and the Bush administration," said Katz. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0281	21	3661	"That can only raise concerns over future arrangements." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0281	22	3727	Aside from the settlements, there is stark disagreement between Washington and Israel over the creation of a Palestinian state, with Obama repeatedly saying he was committed to the principle and Netanyahu thus far refusing to endorse it in public.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0283	1	192	Six people were killed in a West Bank shoot-out on Sunday during an arrest operation for a senior Hamas militant, deepening the rift between the rival Palestinian factions. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0283	2	374	The Islamist Hamas movement ruling the Gaza Strip warned that the rival Fatah movement loyal to president Mahmud Abbas had crossed a "red line" by carrying out the operation which killed two of its members. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0283	3	590	Hamas-Fatah ties sharply deteriorated after the Islamists seized control of Gaza in deadly June 2007 clashes and the Palestinian split is one of the main stumbling blocks in reaching a final Middle East peace deal. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0283	4	814	The gunfight erupted when police tried to arrest Mohammed al-Samman, the commander of Hamas's armed wing in the northern West Bank who was also on Israel's wanted list, Palestinian police and Hamas said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0283	5	1027	Samman barricaded himself in a house in the town of Qalqiliya in the north of the Israeli-occupied territory together with Mohammed Yassin, another Hamas militant and refused to come out, they said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0283	6	1235	The ensuing shoot-out killed both Hamas men, three Palestinian policemen and a civilian. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0283	7	1324	A curfew was imposed on the town near the border with Israel following the incident, police said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0283	8	1431	Hamas lashed out over the incident. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0283	9	1476	"This crime is a red line," the Islamists said in a statement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0283	10	1548	"Hamas puts the complete responsibility of this ugly crime on Abbas and his security forces." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0283	11	1651	Describing Abbas and his forces as agents of arch-enemy Israel, Hamas warned it would respond "with acts," without elaborating. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0283	12	1788	"There is no difference between the occupation who shoots and the people who carry out their missions for them," a spokesman for Hamas's armed wing said at a press conference in Gaza. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0283	13	1981	"Whoever touches our fighters should wait for the answer of the resistance." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0283	14	2067	Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhum said there was no chance of further reconciliation talks with Fatah after the "escalation by security services of Abu Mazen and Fatah against Hamas and its leaders in the West Bank." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0283	15	2288	"Fatah should choose -- dialogue with us or doing the dirty work of the Zionist enemy," Barhum said as Hamas decried the killing over mosque loudspeakers in Gaza City. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0283	16	2465	A senior Palestinian Authority official brushed off the Hamas accusations as "lies." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0283	17	2559	"The Palestinian Authority has one duty -- to impose security and the law and we will not allow what happened in Gaza to happen here in the West Bank under any circumstances," he said on condition of anonymity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0283	18	2779	"We will not allow for any kind of chaos." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0283	19	2831	The two factions have been divided since June 2007, when Hamas booted Abbas's secular Fatah party out of Gaza, leaving him in control only in the occupied West Bank. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0283	20	3006	They held five rounds of talks under Egyptian mediation in an attempt to reconcile but to no avail and the two sides have frequently accused their rivals of campaigns of persecution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0283	21	3198	In a recent report, Amnesty International rights group lambasted both Hamas and Fatah for arbitrary detentions, torture and suppression of freedom of speech in their respective areas of control.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0284	1	165	Iranian security officials defused a bomb planted on a domestic passenger plane, officials said on Sunday, the latest incident of violence ahead of next month's presidential election. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0284	2	358	The attempted bomb attack occurred on Saturday on a Kish Air flight headed to Tehran from the oil-rich western city of Ahvaz near the border with Iraq, the Fars news agency reported.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0284	5	784	The incident occurred just two days after 25 people were killed in a powerful bomb attack on a mosque in Zahedan in southeastern Iran claimed by a shadowy Sunni rebel group. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0284	6	967	"Security officials of the Islamic Republic Revolutionary Guards acted well and the incident caused no casualties," Reza Jafarzadeh, spokesman for Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation, told the state broadcaster. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0284	7	1187	A top security official blamed Iran's "enemies" for the plane bomb, saying they wanted to stoke tensions ahead of the June 12 presidential election. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0284	8	1345	"The suspicious package and the details of the sabotage operation in the Tehran- Ahvaz Boeing is under investigation," Mohammad Hassan Kazemi, the head of the Revolutionary Guards aviation security operations, told the official IRNA news agency. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0284	9	1600	"I do not confirm a link between this and the Zahedan operation," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0284	10	1684	"But we believe our enemies want to create a threatening environment before the presidential election and exploit the open space in the country and spark despair among people."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0284	12	2070	A day later, gunmen on motorbikes fired at an election campaign office of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Zahedan and wounded two campaign members and a child. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0284	13	2240	The province, which is home to Iran's Baluch minority who adhere to Sunni Islam, has been the scene of a deadly insurgency by a Sunni rebel group which is strongly opposed to the government of predominantly Shiite Iran. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0284	14	2469	Iran on Saturday hanged three men in public accused of involvement in Thursday's mosque bombing, just 48 hours after the attack, which was reportedly claimed by the Sunni group Jundullah (Soldiers of God).

AFP_ENG_20090531.0284	16	2760	Iranian officials claim Jundallah is known to have operated on several occasions from across the broder in Pakistan. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0284	17	2886	The mosque attack was reminiscent of a similar outbreak of violence just days before Iran's last presidential election in 2005 which brought Ahmadinejad to power.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0284	20	3350	Iran in the past has blamed US and British agents in neighbouring Iraq and Afghanistan for launching attacks on its border provinces with significant ethnic minority populations.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	1	189	The rebel Georgian region of South Ossetia voted Sunday in polls that could secure the grip of its separatist leader nine months after it was the subject of war between Russia and Georgia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	2	387	The local opposition says Eduard Kokoity is seeking to use the legislative elections to forge a loyal parliamentary majority to push through an amendment allowing him to run again for office when his second term lapses next year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	3	626	Russia -- which outraged the West by recognising South Ossetia as independent in the wake of August's war with Georgia  --- has said South Ossetia should not amend the existing term limits in its constitution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	4	845	Four parties are competing for the 34 seats in the parliament, but the central election commission has barred the only two parties not loyal to Kokoity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	5	1007	Opposition activities said voting would not make a difference. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	6	1070	"I plan to sit at home. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	7	1094	There's nothing we can do," said Alan Gassiyev, an opposition leader, calling the polls "completely illegal." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	8	1213	"It's too bad if he wants to change the constitution," added Grigory Dzassokhov, a 55-year old former history teacher. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	9	1332	"It would be nonsense. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	10	1355	What kind of democracy is that?" 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	11	1397	Critics accuse Kokoity, an ex-wrestling champion, of muzzling opponents and stealing the money sent from Russia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	12	1519	Georgia ridiculed the vote, with the country's reintegration minister Temur Iakobashvili saying the elections were "nothing but clownery, a farce and a redistribution of a criminal power." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	13	1717	Kokoity insisted however the elections were in strict accordance with law, saying the polls were "a maturity test for the small independent state." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	14	1874	A large number of voters at the polling stations was proof that the vote was deemed genuine by people, he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	15	1995	"At 10:00 am I can already say there's a very high turnout," he added.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	18	2314	Kokoity currently does not have the two-thirds of seats in the parliament to amend the constitution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	19	2424	As the region scrambles to rebuild itself in the aftermath of the war, the opposition accuses Kokoity and his circle of diverting lorries carrying construction material and humanitarian aid to traffic the goods in Russia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	20	2655	Out of over 10 billion rubles (320 million dollars, 230 million euros) in aid money budgeted by Moscow, South Ossetian authorities say they have spent just 1.5 billion rubles. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	21	2840	Kokoity -- who built connections in Moscow working as a trade official for the rebel region when it was known as a highway for smuggling in the early 1990s -- has rejected accusations against him as Georgian propaganda. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	22	3069	"With what happened in August we need three to four years to rebuild," Kokoity said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	23	3163	And as the looming political scandal in the region threatens to become an embarrassment for Moscow, there are signs that the Kremlin is scaling back its support for the South Ossetian leader. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	24	3364	Sergey Naryshkin, the head of the Russian presidential administration, said on Russian television this month that South Ossetia should not amend the existing term limits in its constitution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	25	3564	Moscow and Tbilisi fought a brief but intense war last August over the region, which had enjoyed de facto independence since the early 1990s thanks to tacit Russian support. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	26	3747	Following the conflict Russia formally recognised the region as independent, a move followed only by Nicaragua. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	27	3868	Russia took formal control of guarding its borders this month, in a move condemned by the West as a violation of an EU-brokered ceasefire that ended the fighting last August. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0288	28	4052	The vote was a leading news item on the Russian television, which gave it favorable coverage.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0289	1	165	Israel began its largest-ever exercise on Sunday to test the response of emergency services to a "doomsday" mix of missile attacks, suicide bombings and natural disasters. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0289	2	346	The five-day exercise will simulate simultaneous rocket strikes from the Gaza Strip and Lebanon and missile attacks from arch-foes Syria and Iran. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0289	3	502	"The mere fact that Israel is preparing with such an exercise improves our ability to better protect our citizens and ultimately lowers the threat," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the cabinet meeting. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0289	4	723	During the drill, Israel will be staging a "doomsday scenario" of simultaneous strikes against the country, defence ministry spokesman Shlomo Dror told AFP last week. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0289	5	899	This will include conventional, chemical and biological strikes, as well as a wave of Palestinian suicide bombings, against large population centres. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0289	6	1058	Exercise Turning Point 3 will also simulate the conduct of rescue and medical services during earthquakes and epidemics and will involve the participation of schools, government ministers and other state institutions. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0289	7	1285	The drill's main activity will come on Tuesday, when air-raid sirens sound across the country and citizens must scramble to shelters, in some areas within seconds and others within no more than three minutes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0289	8	1503	There will also be simulated cabinet meetings in which ministers will weigh their response to such attacks and scenarios. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0289	9	1634	"Schools, kindergartens and educational institutions across Israel will participate in the exercise, practising emergency entry into protected spaces," the army said in a statement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0289	10	1816	"Rear military bases, governmental offices and public institutions will also practice." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0289	11	1913	It is the third consecutive year Israel is conducting such an exercise, although this year's drill is the largest-ever. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0289	12	2042	"It is an important exercise and it is good that it is happening at this time," Defence Minister Ehud Barak said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0289	13	2165	The manoeuvres were first held in the aftermath of the July-August 2006 war with Lebanon's Hezbollah militia, which revealed major weaknesses in how the Jewish state's homefront dealt with the rocket attacks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0289	14	2383	"The Second Lebanon War revealed that the homefront was not well prepared for war and citizens found it hard to adapt to the special situation," Dror said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0289	15	2548	Deputy Defence Minister Matan Vilnai told army radio on Sunday that "our enemies think that the rear is our weak point, we have to reinforce this front and be ready to face any situation." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0289	16	2746	The drill comes just two weeks after the air force wrapped up a massive four-day exercise that tested its ability to defend against missile and jet strikes from Syria and Iran. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0289	17	2932	It was the first time the army has simulated strikes from the Islamic republic, located more than 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) away.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	1	187	The once mighty US auto industry faces a day of reckoning on Monday with the looming bankruptcy of General Motors and an expected court ruling on the sale of Chrysler to a group led by Italy's Fiat. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	2	395	The global economic crisis has hit the US industry hard, prompting massive intervention by President Barack Obama's administration to prevent total collapse and a new blow to the nation's economy, which is already in recession. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	3	632	A government rescue plan for GM could put as much as 72.5 percent of the country's biggest automaker under state ownership. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	4	765	With the hours counting down for GM, company bondholders with slightly more than 50 percent of GM’s 27.2 billion dollars in bond debt voted Saturday in support of the restructuring plan, The New York Times reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	5	990	Among the backers was a committee of large investors holding about 20 percent of GM’s outstanding bonds, The Times said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	6	1120	No official announcement of the vote tally has yet been made. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	7	1191	Under the plan, the bondholders would obtain the rights to buy an extra 15 percent of GM's stock at a low price. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	8	1304	They would also control 25 percent of the new GM, after having supported the new company's creation in bankruptcy court. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	9	1434	Recalcitrant bondholders who opt for confrontation rather than cooperation "will get nothing or very little," an Obama administration official told reporters Thursday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	10	1611	Government-backed restructuring in bankruptcy court for GM, once the world's largest automaker, appeared all but certain. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	11	1742	Monday marks a deadline imposed by the Obama administration for the company to submit a viable restructuring plan or file for bankruptcy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	12	1889	Meanwhile, a US bankruptcy court judge in New York was widely expected to approve a deal between Chrysler and Fiat on Monday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	13	2024	The third biggest US automaker has declared bankruptcy and is seeking a tie-up with Fiat in a plan presented as the only way to save the company from liquidation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	14	2196	Developments at Chrysler could provide an example for restructuring at GM, which will similarly have to sell some of its brands and close many dealerships. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	15	2361	But the administration official said a 60- to 90-day timeframe was "better" for GM, contrasted with the fast-track process for Chrysler, which filed for bankruptcy protection on April 30. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	16	2558	"This is a much more complicated company than Chrysler, as a global company. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	17	2635	It's three times the size," noted the official. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	18	2692	The United Auto Workers (UAW) union said Friday its members ratified a deal to allow GM to radically cut costs and its debt load, clearing the way for a quick exit from the expected bankruptcy filing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	19	2902	GM also announced plans to retool an idled US plant to build small cars it had originally planned to import, and two more US assembly plants could  potentially be saved. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	20	3081	The automaker, which normally shuts downs plants for two weeks during the summer, is planning longer-than-normal closures at a variety of facilities this summer, The Detroit Free Press reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	21	3285	Some factories will be shut down for as long as nine weeks, according to the newspaper report. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	22	3380	This week, about eight out of its 15 assembly plants will be running. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	23	3459	The bankruptcy filing could also be sped up by a deal struck Saturday after marathon talks that saw Canadian parts maker Magna and its Russian backers taking over GM's Opel. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	24	3642	The deal for GM's European operations, brokered by the German government, amounted to a major development in the remaking of the global auto industry. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	25	3802	GM employs some 50,000 people throughout Europe and Magna plans to cut about a fifth. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	26	3897	German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose government agreed to stump billions of euros (dollars) in loan guarantees and emergency loans to keep the ailing Opel afloat, acknowledged that talks over the future of GM Europe had sometimes been difficult. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	27	4154	Germany's Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck had even denounced what he called "scandalous" US negotiating tactics. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	28	4278	Yet despite what she called "huge mismanagement" by GM executives, a telephone call to Obama helped seal the deal, Merkel said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	29	4415	As for Chrysler, a new company could be born within days of approval for bankruptcy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	30	4500	The Treasury said it had transferred 6.9 billion dollars in public funds to New Carco, a newly created company to acquire Chrysler's "good assets." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	31	4657	If presiding judge Arthur Gonzalez rules against Chrysler, it faces a grim future, with a worst-case scenario being Fiat abandoning the tie-up and the US automaker going into liquidation, with massive job losses. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0291	32	4879	Legal appeals were expected if Gonzalez ruled in favor, meaning possible new delays.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	1	186	Bordeaux, which produces an estimated 700 million bottles of wine each year, may be best known in gastronomic circles for its distinct clarets. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	2	339	But in the world of French football this year's top vintage is a Blanc. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	3	420	In leading Bordeaux to the French league title for the first time in a decade Laurent Blanc has pulled off a double coup. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	4	551	Not only has he taken the Girondins to glory in only his second season as a coach but the 43-year-old from Ales has also managed to cure a bout of nationwide yawning stretching back to 2002. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	5	751	That year, Lyon won their first ever league title after some near misses and romped past all-comers for the next six years. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	6	884	But this year was no one horse race, with Blanc's men landing the crown after a final-day win over relegated Caen gave them 80 points from 38 matches to 77 for Marseille and 71 for Lyon, who next season will have to play in the Champions League qualifiers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	7	1150	"I am really delighted," said Blanc, who pinpointed the win over Lyon five weeks ago as the moment he felt his men were destined to end up as top dogs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	8	1311	"Last year we lost both matches to Lyon, our direct rivals, even if maybe we didn't deserve to. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	9	1407	Then, when Marseille lost to Lyon, that opened the way up for us," noted Blanc, a mainstay of the French side which won the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	10	1570	Blanc, who suggested it would be very difficult to replicate Lyon's long run of titles, said rigorous hard work in training over the winter had been key. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	11	1733	"We really put in some physical grind in January. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	12	1783	What also helped was that we only really realised quite late in the day just what a great run we were on, so we were under less pressure. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	13	1921	And mentally we were very strong - several times we turned things around right at the death when things weren't going well." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	14	2055	Two defeats in their first four games saw Bordeaux make not the brightest of starts and by the end of September they had eight points to make up on Lyon, who retained the margin going into December. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	15	2263	A pre-Christmas purple patch saw Bordeaux close to within three points but draws against struggling Grenoble and Saint Etienne held up progress as Marseille soared into top spot. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	16	2451	By April, Lyon were fading, their confidence dented by yet another failure to impress in Europe as Barcelona dumped them easily in the Champions League second phase, leaving Bordeaux and Marseille to scrap it out. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	17	2674	Lyon then ultimately did Bordeaux a decisive favour with a May 17 win at Marseille's seething Stade Velodrome to prepare the coronation which came with Saturday's denouement, Yoan Gouffran securing the title after a club record 11th consecutive league win. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	18	2940	Gilding Bordeaux's lily was a League Cup win in April while a further bonus was last week's signing up of star playmaker Yoann Gourcuff, who had only been on loan from AC Milan and who has been the French league's shining star this term. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	19	3187	But now they will be judged on whether they can do what Lyon have consistently failed to do - make a good impression in the Champions League. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	20	3338	Lyon have never made it past the quarter-finals while 1993 winners Marseille remain the only French side to lift the European Cup. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	21	3478	Despite his relative touchline inexperience going into that challenge, Blanc will take heart from the success of Barcelona's 38-year-old Pep Guardiola, who outfoxed Sir Alex Ferguson to land the trophy in his debut season as a coach. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	22	3721	For Bordeaux, triumphing in Europe will demand a different, more elastic mentality from that which suffices for domestic fare and they will be only too aware the transition has traditionally proved awkward for French clubs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	23	3954	That might be down to cultural issues for, as any Frenchman knows, the first course is normally washed down with a glass of rouge. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	24	4094	But with Blanc's coaching genius out of the bottle, Bordeaux are now eying dessert. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0293	25	4187	That would normally mean sampling any one of a host of the south west's finest vins blancs - although lifting the Champions League would surely demand an 'upgrade' to champagne.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0294	1	194	An Indian court has upheld a decision by a religious body to deny a female student who plucked her eyebrows admission to a Sikh university, media reports said Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0294	2	370	The ruling said faith-based educational institutions had the right to refuse admission to students who did not meet religious standards, as "maintaining hair unshorn is an essential component of the Sikh religion," according to the Press Trust of India. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0294	3	633	The policy had been challenged by Gurleen Kaur after she was denied admission to the Sri Guru Ram Das Institute of Medical Sciences and Research in the Sikh holy city of Amritsar. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0294	4	822	Kaur was excluded on the grounds that she was not a "true Sikh as she was plucking her eyebrows," according to the Times of India. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0294	5	962	Sikhism requires men and women to keep their hair uncut at all times, and many men sport lengthy beards and wear turbans to cover their long hair. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0294	6	1118	Kaur's petition was supported by male students who had also been refused admission to the university because they trimmed their beards.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0297	1	185	Sri Lanka on Sunday rejected growing calls to probe human rights violations amid allegations that thousands of civilians perished in the final battle against Tamil separatists. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0297	2	371	Media Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said organisations calling for investigations had "ulterior motives," and dismissed demands for independent probes into the final phase of Sri Lanka's war against Tamil separatists. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0297	3	603	"Those who give various civilian casualty figures and call for these probes must have ulterior motives," Abeywardena told reporters here. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0297	4	750	He said the government itself was in the process of assessing the civilian casualties, but gave no figures. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0297	5	867	"Our officials knew how many people were in the (war zone) area and we are taking a tally on the number of people now in the IDP (internally displaced persons) camps," Abeywardena said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0297	6	1062	His remarks came a day after the London-based rights group, Amnesty International, called for an independent probe into the number of civilians killed while government forces crushed Tamil Tiger rebels two weeks ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0297	7	1288	Amnesty also urged the United Nations to reveal its own estimates for civilian casualties.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0298	2	363	"We must overcome this phase with all its ramifications and open a new page to build the nation," the emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, told the new parliament which was elected on May 16 in snap polls 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0298	3	578	The election, the third in the past three years, was called after the emir dissolved the previous parliament following a standoff between MPs and the government.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	1	194	Pakistan's defence secretary said Sunday that a month-long offensive to crush Taliban fighters in the northwest could end within days, as security forces hunted down the militant leadership. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	2	394	Swat valley's main town Mingora is back in government hands, the military announced late Saturday, and Syed Athar Ali told a security forum in Singapore that three targeted northwest districts were almost clear of Taliban rebels. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	3	633	"Operations in Swat, Buner and adjoining areas have almost met complete success," the secretary of defence said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	4	755	"Only five to ten percent job is remaining and hopefully within the next two to three days these pockets of resistance will be cleared." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	5	901	The army remains locked in battle in some areas, but the fall of Mingora was a critical milestone in an offensive launched after the Taliban thrust to within 100 kilometres (60 miles) of Islamabad in April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	6	1117	Security officials also reported that 45 militants were killed in fierce fighting in South Waziristan near the Afghan border, a bolt-hole for Taliban and Al-Qaeda-linked militants south of the current army bombardment. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	7	1345	Washington, which is firmly backing the military drive, had warned that the rebels threatened Pakistan's very existence and identified the country and Afghanistan as central to its 'war on terror'. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	8	1552	"We are trying to target the top leadership of militants and they are constantly being followed," chief military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said as he announced the Mingora win. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	9	1748	Officials said lower-ranking leaders had been killed but it was harder to get to the top leaders, who had a network of hardcore militants around them and had slipped into the rugged mountain terrain. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	10	1957	"They will be eliminated wherever we find them," said one military official, who did not wish to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media, adding: "We believe that they are somewhere in the mountains." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	11	2183	Pakistan has slapped a 600,000-dollar price on the head of firebrand Swat Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah for masterminding the nearly two-year uprising in the valley to enforce sharia law. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	12	2386	Fazlullah led thousands of supporters, a mixture of hardcore ideologues and disenfranchised young men, in a brutal campaign that has beheaded opponents, burned scores of schools and fought government troops since November 2007. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	13	2623	The government has also offered rewards for 21 rebel chiefs -- wanted dead or alive -- from Swat. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	14	2730	But as the government ups its campaign to stamp out the militants, fears are growing of a wave of revenge attacks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	15	2854	The northwestern capital Peshawar and the eastern cultural centre of Lahore have both been rocked by deadly explosions in the last five days, killing a total of 39 people and wounding hundreds more. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	16	3062	A spokesman for Pakistan Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud -- who has a five- million-dollar bounty on his head posted by the United States -- has claimed Wednesday's suicide bombing on a police building in Lahore. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	17	3283	Hakimullah Mehsud also warned of more "massive attacks" to revenge the Swat military operation and in protest at Islamabad's ties with Washington. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	18	3439	In South Waziristan on Sunday, police official Syed Ahmad said that 45 militants and two soldiers were killed as security forces repulsed an attack on army posts. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	19	3611	Fears that the current army offensive could expand into Waziristan have already sent thousands of people there fleeing their homes, although the military have denied any movements in the tribal belt are imminent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	20	3833	Nearly 2.4 million people have already fled the current offensive. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0301	21	3909	The military said it had relaxed its strict curfew Sunday in most parts of the northwest including Mingora to allow people trapped on the roads to return home or leave the region.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	1	191	British Prime Minister Gordon Brown insisted Sunday he would not quit despite a rumbling scandal over MPs expenses and dire poll ratings for his ruling Labour Party ahead of European and local elections. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	2	404	He said the expenses furore was "appalling" and "offends everything that I believe in" as well as promising that every lawmaker would be forced to account for all their expenses from the last four years. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	3	617	A total of 13 lawmakers from Labour and the main opposition Conservatives have said they will stand down since the scandal broke over three weeks ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	4	768	The Daily Telegraph newspaper has been publishing leaked documents detailing hundreds of claims from the public purse for everything from moat cleaning to a duck island. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	5	947	On Sunday, the Telegraph published an ICM poll suggesting Labour would come third in the European elections, in which Britons vote Thursday, with just 17 percent, behind the second opposition centrist Liberal Democrats. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	6	1176	Even more damagingly, it suggested Labour would also come third in a general election with just 22 percent of the vote -- the worst Labour has done in an opinion poll since 1987. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	7	1364	But Brown dismissed suggestions he could step down to make way for a more popular leader in an interview with BBC television. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	8	1499	"Things go up and down," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	9	1533	"We're going through the most difficult economic circumstances the country has faced. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	10	1628	"People are angry rightly because they are worried when they see taxpayers' money wasted on their MPs and they're finding it very difficult for them in a difficult economic situation." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	11	1822	Brown added: "I did not come into politics to allow a situation to develop where MPs ran away with money they did not deserve". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	12	1959	He also said he wanted to introduce a "constitutional renewal" bill and was looking at reforms including the case for a written constitution, votes at 16 and reform of the unelected upper chamber the House of Lords. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	13	2184	Brown said he does "not accept the case for an unelected House of Lords", adding he was "always open" to arguments for reforming of the voting system. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	14	2344	Turnout at European elections in Britain is usually low -- in the last polls in 2004, it was just 38 percent, due in part to strong Eurosceptic sentiment among many. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	15	2510	This time, fringe parties like the anti-EU UK Independence Party and the far-right British National Party are expected to benefit. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0302	16	2650	An Economist magazine/YouGov poll last week found that only 31 percent of Britons think its membership of the European Union is a good thing, compared to 37 percent who think it is bad. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	0	58	Thousands hit by diarrhoea outbreak after Bangladesh cyclone 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	1	203	An outbreak of diarrhoea has spread across Bangladesh's south-west after a cyclone slammed into the south of the country and neighbouring India earlier in the week, officials said Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	2	400	At least 237 people were killed after Cyclone Aila on Monday hit the low-lying coast north of the Bay of Bengal, where a military and civilian relief operation is now underway. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	3	586	Doctors said diarrhoea had broken out at an "alarming rate" as inundation and waterlogging in a vast swathe of land close to the world's largest mangrove forest Sundarbans has destroyed supplies of drinking water. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	4	809	In the worst affected Koyra, Dakope and Khulna districts at least two people have died and over 5000 people treated for diarrhoea, half in the last 24 hours, regional medical chief Lutfur Rahman Khan told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	5	1028	"The situation is alarming. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	6	1056	So far we have more than 5000 people who are sick with diarrhoea in this region. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	7	1137	Another 3000 have been treated for water borne diseases like dysentery," Khan said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	8	1230	Khan said breached levees and washed away embankments enabled tidal seawater to inundate the region, destroying almost all sources of fresh drinking water. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	9	1395	"The crisis is worsening every day. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	10	1431	People are leaving their villages for cities and towns," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	11	1506	In neighbouring Satkhira district doctors have treated over 2000 cases of diarrhoea since the cyclone hit, again with half the cases reported in the last 24 hours, head of the district medical service Mohammad Ibadullah said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	12	1741	The government said it has dispatched nearly 900 medical teams to tackle the crisis but charities and local officials warned any improvement would depend on how soon the authorities can rebuild the destroyed embankments. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	13	1971	The army had brought in fresh water supplies but not enough for the cyclone victims. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	14	2065	On Saturday Oxfam's Bangladesh operations chief Heather Blackwell called the situation "an emerging humanitarian crisis. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	15	2186	And it's getting worse every day," adding more than one million people had been affected. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	16	2285	Some 167 people died in Bangladesh, where hundreds of thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed, while 70 people were killed in India as a result of the cyclone. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	17	2459	Of those killed in India's West Bengal state, 20 were killed in mudslides caused by rainfall a day after the storm hit. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	18	2588	The low-lying region frequently experiences tropical storms and cyclones during the monsoon season. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0303	19	2688	In 2007, more than 3,500 people were killed, most of them in Bangladesh, when Cyclone Sidr lashed the same districts.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0306	1	177	Vietnam has recorded its first case of swine flu after a man tested positive for the virus, the health ministry said Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0306	2	311	"It is the first patient of the virus A(H1N1) in Vietnam," ministry spokesman Nguyen Huy Nga told AFP, adding that the case was "confirmed officially by our ministry this morning." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0306	3	501	An initial test at the tropical diseases hospital in southern Ho Chi Minh City was positive, and two follow-up tests at the city's Pasteur Institute confirmed the diagnosis, Phan Van Tu, a doctor with the Institute, told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0306	4	736	The patient, a 23-year-old man, was in a stable condition with a slight fever, Tu added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0306	5	834	State television reported that the patient returned home early last week from the United States via Hong Kong. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0306	6	954	The World Health Organization (WHO) said it had been formally notified of the case. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0306	7	1047	It said the patient sought medical attention after noticing flu symptoms a day after returning from the United States. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0306	8	1166	Five members of his family have been given medication and placed in isolation, while passengers on the same flight as the man are being tracked down, the WHO said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0306	9	1339	Emergence of the virus in Vietnam was "highly likely" given the country's international travel links, Shelaye Boothey, a WHO spokeswoman, told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0306	10	1496	Vietnam has been monitoring the health of passengers arriving at its airports in a bid to detect swine flu.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	0	58	Europe's desperate bid to bring out voters 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	1	176	European leaders on Sunday stepped up a desperate battle to persuade people to vote for the EU parliament this week, but the campaign has opened up new political divisions across the continent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	2	379	With polls indicating a record low turnout for the June 4-7 election, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a joint plea to voters, saying a strong parliament was essential to confront the economic crisis. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	3	632	The two leaders said they want "a strong Europe that protects" its people and called for "all Europeans to vote" in the statement, published by the Journal du Dimanche newspaper in France and Die Welt am Sonntag in Germany. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	4	865	A "strong Europe does not necessarily mean more powers for the European Union, even more European legislation or even more financial means," said Merkel and Sarkozy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	5	1040	First steps "to assure real European regulation in the financial sector, based on coordination and cooperation between regulators" should be taken at the next EU summit in June, they said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	6	1238	"For speculative funds, tax havens, payment for executives and financial traders, we want an exemplary Europe," they added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	7	1371	The pair also gave strong backing to the Lisbon reform treaty, intended to streamline EU decision-making but deadlocked by Ireland's rejection in a referendum last year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	8	1550	"Europe must play a leading role in the world. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	9	1597	For that, it must have efficient institutions. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	10	1644	That is why we need the Lisbon Treaty," they said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	11	1704	Merkel and Sarkozy also reaffirmed opposition to Turkey joining the EU, without naming the country. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	12	1804	"To be able to act, the EU needs frontiers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	13	1848	Unlimited enlargement is not possible." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	14	1897	The joint statement highlighted fears that the vote for the 736 member European assembly could prove a new embarrassment for the 27-nation European Union, after a record 45 percent abstention at the last election in 2004. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	15	2128	In France, a poll for the Le Parisien newspaper Sunday suggested that 55 percent of the nation's would not bother going to the polls. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	16	2262	In Britain, Poland and Romania, fewer than one in three plan to vote, according to recent surveys. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	17	2370	In Spain, which has benefited enormously from EU development funds, political analysts expect turnout of 40 percent at best. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	18	2495	Portugal expects a record abstention rate. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	19	2547	The stakes are higher now, however, as the European Parliament -- the only directly elected EU institution -- will have a bigger voice in decisions that affect 500 million Europeans if the Lisbon treaty comes into force. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	20	2777	"A lot of voters don't understand what the European Parliament does," said Philip White, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform think- tank in London. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	21	2955	"You're not voting to keep a government in office or kick it out. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	22	3021	The stakes can seem a little bit less clear than they are in national elections." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	23	3112	But in many countries the EU vote will be a test of the national governments in power, with far-right and left-wing parties expected to benefit from protest votes and low turnouts in some member states. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	24	3324	In Britain, where euroscepticism runs deep, the governing Labour Party is expected to garner only 16 to 17 percent of the vote, putting it in third place against the rival Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, weekend polls in the Times and Sunday Telegraph suggested. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	25	3601	The leader of the main opposition Conservatives, David Cameron, has opened up new divisions in Europe by saying he would withdraw his party from the main centre-right bloc in the EU parliament, the European People's Party (EPP), and join a new eurosceptic alliance with Czech and Polish parties. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	26	3906	The EPP is still expected to remain the biggest single party in the parliament, which already has a key role approving the EU budget and passing laws on a wide range of issues. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	27	4092	The parliament will also endorse the new president of the European Commission after a nomination is made by the EU summit. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0307	28	4215	Jose Manuel Barroso, the conservative former Portuguese prime minister, is widely expected to get a second term.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0310	2	357	He has been invited to the NBA Dallas Mavericks' pre-summer mini-camp on June 11-12 and will skip the inaugural East Asian championships to be held in the central Japanese city of Komaki in mid-June.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	1	180	The Niger president's dismissal of parliament and plans for a referendum to allow him a third term have sparked deep concern, with the opposition calling it a coup bid in the uranium-producing nation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	2	390	Mamadou Tandja, a former colonel elected president in 1999 following a military coup, on Friday announced he would go ahead with plans for a referendum on a new constitution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	3	574	If approved, it would allow him to stay in power after his second five-year term expires on December 22. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	4	688	His announcement came after the Constitutional Court, the nation's highest, said Monday it was opposed to the holding of the referendum. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	5	834	On Tuesday, Tandja dissolved parliament, which was reportedly on the verge of objecting to his plans, before it could make its position known. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	6	977	Tandja, 71, did not give a date for the referendum. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	7	1038	The moves caused alarm at both home and abroad. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	8	1095	Niger's main opposition group said it sees Tanjda's determination to push ahead with the referendum despite the refusal of the nation's highest court and the reluctance of parliament as being tantamount to a coup. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	9	1318	"Right from the minute Tandja says he was calling a referendum, he ... loses his legitimacy as he'll have proclaimed a coup. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	10	1443	We will treat him as a mere putschist," Hassoumi Massaoudou of the Niger Party for Democracy and Socialism (PNDS) said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	11	1572	Tandja took part in the 1974 coup that toppled the country's first civilian president, Diori Hamani, and was a pillar of the military regime that governed Niger until the advent of multi-party politics in 1991. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	12	1792	Both the United States and Canada expressed concern about the developments in the country, which despite being a major uranium producer has also been one of the world's poorest nations. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	13	1987	"We believe this risks undercutting Niger's hard won social, political, and economic gains of the past decade, and would be a set-back for democracy, based on the regular, peaceful transition of political power and faithful adherence to constitutional due-process," said US State Department spokesman Ian Kelly. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	14	2299	Canadian Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon said in a statement that his country was following the events "with concern" and "considers that respect for the integrity of democratic institutions and mechanisms is paramount to a firm commitment to democracy." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	15	2564	One analyst said the president's actions were a reminder of past turmoil. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	16	2647	"The history of Niger has shown that once there is political impasse ... the military tends to intervene," Abubakar Sadiq, a political science professor at Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria in neighbouring Nigeria, told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	17	2880	"This is why what Tandja is doing is very, very dangerous. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	18	2948	"Tandja of course belongs to the military class, being a former colonel ... but that is not a guarantee the military will not strike." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	19	3092	Parliamentarians from French-speaking countries, meeting in Dakar earlier this week, also called for the "strict respect" of Niger's constitution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	20	3248	The regional grouping the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) warned that Niger could face sanctions if it forged ahead with the referendum. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	21	3413	But Libyan leader and current African Union head Moamer Khadafi, himself in power for the past four decades, was more understanding of Tandja's position. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	22	3576	"If the people decide the president deserves to be re-elected, they can choose him once, three times or even 10 times," he said at a regional summit Friday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	23	3742	Sadiq said "the world should not keep quiet and allow the rape of democracy again in Niger." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	24	3844	"The situation in Niger Republic is symptomatic of a trend in Africa where democracy is not well entrenched. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	25	3953	Virtually all African leaders don't respect democratic institutions, they only want to remain in power until they die," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0312	26	4091	"Pressure has to be brought to bear on Tandja by the whole Nigerian nation, the African Union and the international community to respect the constitution of Niger Republic." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	0	58	Israel fumes over US settlement demands 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	1	174	Israel refused on Sunday to bow to US calls for a freeze to all settlement activity in the occupied West Bank, as it fumed over the "unfair" demands that have raised tensions between the close allies. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	2	384	"I want to say in a crystal clear manner that the current Israeli government will not accept in any fashion that legal settlement activity be frozen," said Transport Minister Yisrael Katz, a close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	3	633	The premier himself did not address the issue at the opening of the weekly cabinet meeting, but the fighting words were echoed by other members of the largely right-wing cabinet, including from its most liberal party Labour. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	4	867	A senior Israeli official complained that Washington under President Barack Obama -- who has vowed to pursue Middle East peace talks as part of a changed approach to the region -- was placing unfair demands on its close ally. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	5	1102	"The Americans have demanded almost nothing from the Palestinians but are asking Israel to take steps that are a real sacrifice. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	6	1231	These demands are unfair," he told AFP on condition of anonymity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	7	1306	"The Palestinians are taking a passive approach. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	8	1355	They're not even ready to meet the Israeli side and Abu Mazen (Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas) wants the Americans to do all the work," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	9	1513	Abbas, who met Obama last week, 10 days after the US president met Netanyahu, has vowed that that he will not relaunch talks unless Israel freezes settlements in the occupied West Bank. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	10	1708	The Obama administration has demanded that Israel stop all its activity in the settlements, including the so-called natural growth construction that allows for building to accommodate a growing population. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	11	1923	The unusually blunt talk over one of the top stumbling points in the stalled Middle East peace process has raised alarm bells in Israel that the new US president could put pressure on the Jewish state as part of his new approach to the Muslim world. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	12	2182	"This is an unjustifiable demand that the government and the public do not accept," Interior Minister Eli Yishai of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	13	2338	Social Affairs Minister Isaac Herzog of the centre-left Labour party that is the most liberal in Netanyahu's government, said that "one has to understand that there are various statuses within the settlements" and "saying that the picture is black and white or write or wrong is wrong." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	14	2634	More than 280,000 Israelis live in settlements dotted throughout the West Bank, which Israeli captured in war in 1967. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	15	2753	The international community considers all settlements illegal. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	16	2825	Israeli officials have also complained that Obama's administration has yet to say it will honour commitments in a letter that then US president George W. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	17	2979	Bush sent to then Israeli premier Ariel Sharon in 2004. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	18	3044	Bush said that given the existence of major Israeli settlement blocs in the West Bank it was "unrealistic" to expect Israel to fully withdraw from the territory as part of a final peace deal. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	19	3245	"This administration has not yet recognised the arrangements made between the Israeli government and the Bush administration," said Katz. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	20	3383	"That can only raise concerns over future arrangements." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0313	21	3449	Aside from the settlements, there is stark disagreement between Washington and Israel over the creation of a Palestinian state, with Obama repeatedly saying he was committed to the principle and Netanyahu thus far refusing to endorse it in public.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0314	1	172	One Yemeni protestor was killed and five others wounded on Sunday in clashes with police who used firearms to break up an anti-government demonstration in southern Yemen, medical sources said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0314	2	374	"One protester, Tufiq al-Jaadi, died while being operated on in hospital. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0314	3	448	He was hit by a bullet," medical sources said after the incident in Dali, 180 kilometres (110 miles) north of the southern port of Aden. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0314	4	594	Witnesses said police exchanged fire with demonstrators who carried banners with slogans against the government, which is controlled by northerners. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0314	5	752	The demonstration in Dali was on its second day, witnesses said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0314	6	826	Twelve other Yemenis, including four soldiers, have been killed in clashes in the south since demonstrations broke out late April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0314	7	957	The Sanaa government has blamed the demonstrations on southern separatists.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0314	10	1339	The president has warned against the risks of Yemen breaking up into "several entities" amid trouble in the south over the past year, triggered by social demands and charges of negligence in the impoverished state. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	0	58	French physicists claim breakthrough in ultra-fast data access 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	1	193	French physicists said on Sunday they had used ultra-fast lasers that could accelerate storage and retrieval of data on hard discs by up to 100,000 times, pointing the way to a new generation of IT wizardry. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	2	410	The research builds on achievements that earned the 2007 Nobel physics prize for Albert Fert of France and Peter Gruenberg of Germany, who ushered in a revolution in miniaturised storage in the 1990s. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	3	620	Fert and Gruenberg discovered that tiny changes in magnetic fields can yield a large electric output. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	4	731	These differences in turn cause changes in the current in the readout head that scans a hard disk to spot the ones and zeroes in which data is stored. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	5	891	That discovery opened the way to "spintronics", a form of electronics that uses not only electrical charge but also the spin of electrons in individual atoms to provide a more compact, denser storage on hard drives. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	6	1116	But reading and writing data through spintronics has been hampered by the relative slowness of magnetic sensors. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	7	1238	In a study published in the specialist journal Nature Physics, a team led by Jean-Yves Bigot of the Institute of Materials Physics and Chemistry in Strasbourg employed a "femtosecond" laser, using ultra-fast bursts of laser light, to alter electron spin and thus speed up retrieval and storage. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	8	1542	"Our method is called the photonics of spin, because it is photons [particles of light] that modify the state of the electrons' magnetisation" on the storage surface, Bigot told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	9	1734	Data is retrieved with a burst that lasts just a millionth of a billionth of a second, said Bigot. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	10	1842	Femtosecond lasers currently measure around 30 centimetres (12 inches) by 10 centimetres (four inches) which means they are too big for consumer electronics, he cautioned. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	11	2023	Bigot added, though, that their miniaturisation is likely to be achieved over the next decade. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0315	12	2127	IBM, Hitachi and other corporations are "extremely interested" by the research, Bigot said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0316	2	358	Telltale variants in chromosomes 5, 6 and 12 are linked with an increased risk of the disease, according to their study, which compared the genetic code of 730 men who had testicular cancer with that of healthy men. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0316	3	583	Inheriting the basket of three factors boosts the risk of the cancer, called testicular gem cell tumour, by up to fourfold. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0316	4	716	The study is published online in the journal Nature Genetics. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0316	5	787	"We have known for some time that men whose father, brothers or sons had testicular cancer are much more likely to get it themselves and we have been searching for this genetic link," said one of the investigators, Elizabeth Rapley of the Institute of Cancer Research, in the southern English county of Surrey. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0316	6	1107	"We believe there are more (risk factors) still to be found and we are working on identifying the rest." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0316	7	1221	The three telltales lie near genes that nurture testicular cells which are precursors in sperm development. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0316	8	1338	Worldwide incidence of testicular cancer is 7.5 cases per 100,000 men, but the rates vary remarkably between countries and according to ancestry, the ICR said in a press release. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0316	9	1526	Why this is so is unclear. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0316	10	1553	Inheritance, though, is a well-known risk factor and seems to be far higher than for other cancer types. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0316	11	1667	Studies have found that the risk to brothers of testicular cancer patients is eight to 10 times higher than the general population, while for fathers of patients, the risk is four to six times higher. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0316	12	1877	Testicular cancer is 99 percent curable if caught in its early stages, the ICR said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	0	58	Iran's city of migrants set for intense vote battle 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	1	193	With less than two weeks until Iran's presidential election, Islamshahr -- a city of migrant workers on the outskirts of Tehran -- is gearing up for an intense election battle. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	2	379	Located southwest of the capital, Islamshahr, a city of 500,000 inhabitants, had largely voted for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad during the 2005 presidential poll. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	3	542	But four years on, the situation has changed in the city of migrants who have come from various provinces of Iran to earn a livelihood. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	4	687	Ahmadinejad, who is seeking a second term in office, is still popular in Islamshahr, but his key challenger in the June 12 poll -- former prime minister Mir Hossein Mousavi -- is making deep inroads. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	5	896	While the incumbent conservative president appears to be assured of the support of middle and lower income voters, Mousavi is gaining popularity among the city's shopkeepers and traders. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	6	1092	He was due to address a campaign rally in the city on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	7	1163	"He is a good man. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	8	1182	During the war, he handled the situation very well," said Hamzeh Shirzad, 38, speaking about Mousavi who was Iran's prime minister in the 1980s when Iran fought an eight-year war with Iraq. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	9	1381	Mousavi is regarded as having steering Iran's economy efficiently during the war, which erupted when the Islamic revolution that toppled the shah was still in an infant stage. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	10	1566	Shirzad, who owns a fruit and vegetable shop in the centre of Islamshahr, is clear of his choice for president. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	11	1687	A green poster bearing a picture of Mousavi adorns the wall behind him as he sorts vegetables in a rather empty shop. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	12	1805	Green is the colour of Mousavi's election campaign. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	13	1866	Large banners and posters of Mousavi have sprung up in the dusty streets of Islamshahr, where ethnic Turkish-speaking Azeris and Kurds mingle with Persians. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	14	2032	In recent years the city -- which saw violent demonstrations in 2000 by residents protesting against poor living conditions -- has also attracted numerous young Tehran couples unable to afford high rents in the capital. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	15	2261	Pictures of Mousavi, who was Iran's last premier before the post was scrapped in 1989, have been plastered on street lights, stalls and shop windows. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	16	2420	Over the past two decades Mousavi, a moderate, has been in the political wilderness, but he is now attempting a comeback and has emerged as the main rival to conservative Ahmadinejad. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	17	2613	"The economy is in crisis again and he is the right man to stop it from worsening," said Shirzad, an ethnic Azeri who has been living in Islamshahr for more than 20 years. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	18	2794	"Last year I used to earn five million rials (500 dollars) a month. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	19	2862	Now I am losing money," said the fruit and vegetable vendor. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	20	2932	"The prices of all food items have doubled. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	21	2976	A kilo of watermelon used to cost 3,500 rials (35 cents). 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	22	3034	It now costs 7,000 rials," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	23	3070	"I will definitely vote for Mousavi." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	24	3117	His view is shared by Ali Karimi, a 23-year-old factory worker. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	25	3190	"Mousavi is the right choice. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	26	3220	Even if the situation remains bad, he can stop it from worsening." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	27	3296	Energy-rich Iran is reeling under an inflation rate of about 25 percent amid the expansionist policies of Ahmadinejad and Mousavi has vowed to slice inflation to a single digit if he is elected. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	28	3500	Few campaign posters for Ahmadinejad are seen in the streets of Islamshahr, but the hardline president has substantial support in the city's low-income areas such as the Tohid neighbourhood. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	29	3700	"He is one of us," said Hossein Khorsavi, 63, a retired commerce ministry employee who moved to Islamshahr three decades ago from his native province of Gilan in the north. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	30	3882	"He has done good work for labourers and retired people," Khorsavi told AFP, adding that he expected the government to keep its promise and increase his monthly pension of 4.2 million rials after the election. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	31	4101	Mousavi's absence from politics since 1989 is seen as a negative point by Khorsavi. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	32	4194	"We do not know what he did in these 20 years, while Ahmadinejad has done good for workers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	33	4286	We will vote for him," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	34	4327	For Mehdi Mahmoudi, 18, Ahmadinejad is the man of the hour, much due to his strong anti-Israel tirades. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	35	4440	"I like those speeches. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	36	4464	He is courageous," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	37	4501	"I trust someone who is like us. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	38	4534	Ahmadinejad is the man. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	39	4558	If there are two people in trouble, he will first help the one who is in a real bad situation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0317	40	4653	He helps the poor." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	0	58	Slack rebuilding angers battered South Ossetia 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	1	191	The windows of the houses are still blown-out, rusting armaments are everyday objects in the streets and the only heating in a bitter winter came from wood- burning stoves. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	2	373	Residents of Tskhinvali -- the "capital" of Georgia's breakaway region of South Ossetia battered in the August war between Moscow and Tbilisi -- could be forgiven for wondering if anything has changed in the last nine months. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	3	608	Russia vowed to plough hundreds of millions of dollars into the region of 50,000 people high in the Caucasus mountains after recognising South Ossetia's independence. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	4	775	But the legacy of the fighting remains all too apparent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	5	841	"Half of Tskhinvali is destroyed and nothing has been done. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	6	901	Russia sent money, but it's up to the government to build things," complained Nadar Sokhrebov, 70. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	7	1009	A GRAD rocket still leans propped against the wall of his stone house, gutted in the fighting. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	8	1104	Since August, he has lived squeezed with 10 family members in a one-room cottage previously used for storage. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	9	1223	The sheared-off top of a tank has been left upright in the centre of the rebel capital Tskhinvali as a monument to the recent war. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	10	1363	In the city's old Jewish quarter -- an area rocked by the heaviest fighting after the Georgian assault on August 8 to restore its control over South Ossetia -- homes crumpled by rocket fire look as they did last summer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	11	1592	As the region votes Sunday in legislative elections marked by the sidelining of the opposition to rebel president Eduard Kokoity, questions are mounting over what the local authorities have done with Moscow's money. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	12	1817	"Those who don't have their own means to rebuild are just waiting and waiting for when the government does something," said Anna Parastayeva, adding her husband had bought all the materials to patch up their own home. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	13	2044	"A fact is a fact -- people lived through the winter as if they were on the street, with it all leaking into their homes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	14	2166	That is what I saw," she sighed. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	15	2208	Only two days ago, some ruined houses were bulldozed in the authorities' first moves at housing reconstruction, residents said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	16	2345	Russia has budgeted over 10 billion rubles (320 million dollars, 230 million euros) in postwar reconstruction funds to the region on top of subsidies put aside before the conflict in 2008. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	17	2543	Kokoity acknowledged that there were "specific problems" and the first phase of the reconstruction did not include private homes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	18	2673	But he insisted that the process was now on track. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	19	2733	"I think that by June 10, South Ossetia will be transformed into one huge construction site," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	20	2845	South Ossetia -- backed by Moscow since it won de-facto autonomy in a first war in the early 1990s -- more than ever seems a Russian protectorate. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	21	3001	Other than Russia, the distant Central American state of Nicaragua is the only other country to have recognised the rebel region. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	22	3140	"True, I can travel to Nicaragua now, but I don't even have a home to go back to and there's no work there," taxi driver German Zaseyev said sarcastically. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	23	3305	Before, residents in this rural region depended on supplies bought in Georgia and could travel just one hour to Tbilisi for medical help. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	24	3452	Now their only outside link is a 120 kilometre (75 mile) drive to Russia over a winding mountain road often blocked by avalanches throughout the long winter. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	25	3619	There is just one factory in South Ossetia that produces building material, a small asphalt plant, but even it is not often working. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	26	3752	Georgia also cut gas supplies to the region in the wake of the war. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0318	27	3829	After moving between friends' houses for a few weeks at a time all winter, Gregory Dzassokhov set up a tent in the yard behind his destroyed house on Khetagurova street for his family this summer.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0322	1	165	Iranian security officials defused a bomb planted on a domestic passenger plane, officials said on Sunday, the latest incident of violence in the run-up to the June 12 presidential election. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0322	2	365	The attempted bomb attack occurred on Saturday on a Kish Air flight headed to Tehran from the oil-rich western city of Ahvaz near the border with Iraq, the Fars news agency reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0322	3	557	"Last night, 15 minutes after the plane with 131 passengers took off, flight security guards found a handmade bomb placed in the lavatory," Fars said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0322	4	708	"The plane landed immediately at Ahvaz airport and the bomb was defused." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0322	5	791	The incident occurred just two days after a bomb attack on a mosque in southeastern Iran claimed by a Sunni rebel group killed 25 people, while Ahvaz itself has witnessed several bouts of unrest in recent years. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0322	6	1012	"Security officials of the Islamic Republic Revolutionary Guards acted well and the incident caused no casualties," Reza Jafarzadeh, spokesman for Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation, told the state broadcaster. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0322	7	1232	The passengers were calmed and the plane continued the flight to Tehran, Kish Air manager Reza Nakhjavani told the ILNA news agency. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0322	8	1374	On Thursday, a suicide bomber killed 25 worshippers and wounded 125 in a Shiite mosque in Zahedan, capital of the southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan province bordering Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0322	9	1574	A day later, gunmen on motorbikes fired at an election campaign office of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Zahedan and wounded two campaign members and a child. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0322	10	1744	The province, which is home to Iran's Baluch minority who adhere to Sunni Islam, has been the scene of a deadly insurgency by a Sunni rebel group which is strongly opposed to the government of predominantly Shiite Iran. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0322	11	1973	Iran on Saturday hanged three men in public accused of involvement in Thursday's mosque bombing, just 48 hours after the attack, which was reported claimed by the Sunni group Jundullah (Soldiers of God). 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0322	12	2186	The mosque attack was reminiscent of a similar outbreak of violence just days before Iran's last presidential election in 2005 which brought Ahmadinejad to power.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0324	3	581	"I was very surprised as I have tried many, many times to come," said Xiong, who arrived Saturday night, the first time he had set foot on Chinese soil in 17 years. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0324	4	755	"I hope in the future I can not only go to Hong Kong, but also to Beijing," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0324	5	850	On Sunday, he took part in an annual March to mark the military crackdown on the pro-democracy protests and said he would join the candlelight vigil in the city this Thursday, which is expected to be attended by tens of thousands. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0324	6	1090	The 1989 military crackdown in Beijing followed weeks of protests and left hundreds, possibly thousands dead across Beijing and led to the imprisonment of scores of protesters. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0324	7	1276	Xiong, a law graduate, met then-Premier Li Peng during the demonstrations 20 years ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0324	8	1373	He was placed on a list of 21 most-wanted students in the weeks after the crackdown and jailed for two years, before being smuggled out of China via Hong Kong to the United States.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0324	11	1864	Several other Tiananmen dissidents have been denied entry to Hong Kong in recent years, although the city operates a separate legal and immigration system from mainland China. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0324	12	2049	Commenting on Xiong's entry, chairman of the city's Democratic Party, Albert Ho, told AFP he was surprised and said it was "probably due to an omission" by the immigration authorities. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0324	13	2243	Meanwhile, a Danish sculptor who flew to Hong Kong to protest the Tiananmen crackdown has been refused entry to the city.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	1	205	South Korea will Monday host one of its biggest-ever diplomatic gatherings, overshadowed by the growing security threat from North Korea. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	2	352	Seoul planned the ASEAN-Korea Commemorative Summit to promote its "New Asia Initiative" to strengthen its ties with the continent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	3	492	But North Korea's relations with its neighbour and the world have worsened dramatically in recent months. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	4	607	Last week it tested its second nuclear bomb, renounced the truce in force on the Korean peninsula and threatened attacks on the South. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	5	751	Seoul has heightened vigilance for the June 1-2 meetings with leaders of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations on the southern resort island of Jeju. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	6	925	"During the summit meetings, our military will escalate its alert and mobilise additional intelligence assets," Lieutenant General Jang Kwang-Il of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said last week. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	7	1124	Military analysts say any North Korean action would likely be staged well away from Jeju, but timed to coincide with the summit to cause maximum embarrassment. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	8	1293	Security was tight, with a surface-to-air missile unit set up next to the convention centre, checkpoints on major roads and explosives-sniffing dogs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	9	1452	Yonhap news agency said 5,000 police officers are patrolling the island and operating high-tech chemical detectors. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	10	1568	Patrol boats and destroyers were stationed near the venue. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	11	1636	"We are maintaining watertight security to cope with all possible contingencies," a senior summit organiser told AFP, declining to link the measures to any potential North Korean threat. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	12	1832	Seoul says North Korea will be a topic at the summit, called to mark the 20th anniversary of relations between South Korea and ASEAN. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	13	1975	Leaders will also debate the global financial crisis, climate change and regional cooperation in trade, economic matters, security and culture. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	14	2128	"In recent years, especially as we entered the 21st century, Asia has emerged as a great power economically and in many other aspects," South Korean President Lee Myung-Bak said recently. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	15	2325	"That is why cooperation within the Asian region is important and that is why it is especially important to improve ties between Korea and ASEAN." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	16	2481	The Southeast Asian leaders will discuss the trial of Myanmar's pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi on the sidelines of the summit, Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said Sunday in a television programme. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	17	2701	ASEAN has been reluctant to speak out against its most notorious member Myanmar, but in May it expressed "grave concern" over the trial and reiterated its demand for her freedom. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	18	2889	Aung San Suu Kyi was charged with violating the terms of her house arrest after an uninvited American swam to her lakeside home. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	19	3018	She has been under various forms of detention without trial for more than 13 of the past 19 years. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	20	3126	Some 700 business leaders from the 11 countries began their own summit Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	21	3205	Abhisit in a keynote speech said Asia and especially East Asia would emerge relatively stronger from the global downturn. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	22	3336	"In my view, the current crisis will not dampen but hasten the rise of Asia as the centre of growth and prosperity," the Thai prime minister said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	23	3492	South Korea sees ASEAN's almost 600 million people as a market for its export- dominated economy that can offset the recession in developed countries. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	24	3652	The resource-poor nation is also eyeing the bloc's abundant raw materials. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0325	25	3736	ASEAN is already South Korea's third-largest trading partner, with two-way trade worth around 90 billion dollars last year, and its second-largest destination for overseas investment.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	1	191	Thousands of protesters marched through Hong Kong on Sunday to commemorate the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing 20 years ago, including one of the leaders from Tiananmen Square. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	2	398	Organisers said around 5,000 people rallied through the streets of the city to mark the anniversary of the military crackdown, which left hundreds, possibly thousands dead following weeks of protests in the capital. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	3	623	Among the marchers was Xiong Yan, a leading student protester during the 1989 demonstrations who now lives in exile in the United States. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	4	770	He was surprisingly allowed into Hong Kong on Saturday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	5	835	Lee Cheuk-yan, a pro-democracy legislator in Hong Kong and one of the organisers of the annual march, said it was crucial that the city continued to mark the events of 20 years ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	6	1026	"We are the only place on Chinese soil that can commemorate June 4," he told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	7	1117	"Hong Kong has become the conscience of China to remember... the crime of the Tiananmen Square massacre and push the regime (in Beijing) to admit their mistakes." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	8	1289	The attendance at the march was sharply up on last year's figures. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	9	1356	An annual candlelit vigil on Thursday is expected to attract tens of thousands. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	10	1445	Xiong, who was put on a list of the authorities' 21 "most-wanted" student protesters after the occupation of Tiananmen was broken up, spent two years in jail before being smuggled to the US via Hong Kong. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	11	1659	His entry was unexpected because of China's sensitive attitude to any criticism of the crackdown. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	12	1757	Other 1989 campaigners have been refused entry in the past. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	13	1826	"I was very surprised as I have tried many, many times to come," said Xiong, who arrived Saturday night, the first time he had set foot on Chinese soil in 17 years. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	14	2000	"I hope in the future I can not only go to Hong Kong, but also to Beijing," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	15	2095	The marchers gathered in the city's Victoria Park, waving banners with slogans such as "Pass the torch on, relay the message of democracy to those who come after us" and "Speak the truth, never forget." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	16	2307	The rally included a small group of mainland Chinese students, who wore t-shirts citing former Communist leader Mao Zedong: "Whoever suppresses student movements is going to have a bad ending." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	17	2510	"I am very excited to see so many people, as this is forbidden on the mainland," said one of the students, 20, who did not want to be named. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	18	2660	"(It shows) there is hope," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	19	2707	Meanwhile, a Danish sculptor who flew to Hong Kong to protest the bloody crackdown was refused entry. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0326	20	2818	Jens Galschiot, whose sculpture commemorating those who died in the 1989 military crackdown, "Pillar of Shame," is displayed at Hong Kong University, was stopped by officials Saturday and sent back to Zurich, an immigration spokesman confirmed.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	1	182	Troops killed 12 Taliban linked to a battle with US troops earlier this month that caused scores of civilian casualties, officials said Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	2	335	Afghan and US forces raided late Saturday a group of militants said to have gathered to plan an attack in Afghanistan's southwestern province of Farah, the deputy provincial governor said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	3	533	"Afghan soldiers and US Special Forces surrounded them to arrest them. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	4	604	Taliban fought back but all of the 12, including their commander, were killed," deputy governor Mohammad Younus Rasoli told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	5	742	The raid was in the district of Khaki Safed which adjoins Bala Buluk, where heavy fighting between insurgents and troops in early May led the soldiers to call in air strikes that killed villagers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	6	948	The Afghan government said 140 civilians, many of them children, were killed in the US air strikes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	7	1048	The US military acknowledges 20-30 may have died in the fighting along with 60-65 Taliban. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	8	1148	A spokesman for the Afghan military in western Afghanistan, Basir Khan Ghori, said the targeted group was involved in the battle in Bala Buluk. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	9	1301	The militants had also shot rockets into the town of Farah on May 19 when President Hamid Karzai had visited to meet victims of the air strikes, he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	10	1464	There were reports of rockets fired into the town the night before the visit but they caused no casualties. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	11	1581	Government figures for those killed and wounded in the Bala Buluk strikes makes it one of the deadliest incidents for civilians since international troops invaded Afghanistan in late 2001 to remove the Taliban for sheltering Al-Qaeda. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	12	1825	Rasoli, the deputy governor, said troops would continue operating to secure the area ahead of August 20 elections. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	13	1949	In Bala Buluk, meanwhile, Taliban attacked a police post and killed six policemen, Abdul Rauf Ahmadi, spokesman for the western police, told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0329	14	2104	Two others were missing and there were also Taliban casualties but authorities did not have a figure, he said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	1	193	Unlikely Scottish singing sensation Susan Boyle was dealt a blow Saturday when she lost out to a troupe of young street dancers in the final of the British talent show that made her a global star. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	2	399	Despite winning praise from the audience and the judges in her final performance on live television, Boyle, 48, graciously accepted second place, saying the "best people won" and wishing the winners "all the best". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	3	623	Boyle enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame over the past two months after video footage of her audition piece for the show, "I Dreamed A Dream" from the musical "Les Miserables", was posted on YouTube. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	4	829	It has had about 100 million hits and brought her celebrity fans including actress Demi Moore and rock star Jon Bon Jovi who embraced the dowdy spinster from small-town Scotland with a voice worthy of Broadway. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	5	1049	Bookmakers made her the favourite to win, but after an unconvincing semi-final performance there were fears the unemployed church volunteer, who lives alone with her cat outside Edinburgh, was suffering under the pressure. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	6	1281	In a live performance in the "Britain's Got Talent" final Saturday, however, Boyle proved the critics wrong and repeated her audition piece with gusto. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	7	1442	One of the three judges, Piers Morgan, called it the "greatest performance I've seen on the history of 'Britain's Got Talent' -- you should win the competition, I loved it." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	8	1625	Boyle was up against nine other acts to win the show, which brings with it a cheque for 100,000 pounds (115,000 euros, 160,000 dollars) and the chance to perform for Queen Elizabeth II. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	9	1820	More than one million viewers cast their vote following the live performances -- but in the end, Boyle lost out to a multi-ethnic posse of 10 street dancers aged 12 to 25 from London and Essex called Diversity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	10	2040	Following her performance, Boyle -- wearing a grey-blue, long sequined dress -- gushed appreciation for her worldwide fan base. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	11	2177	"I want to thank people for all the support they've given me," she said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	12	2259	Asked if it was worth all the media pressure, she replied: "Well worth it!... 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	13	2337	I really feel at home on stage, I'm among friends." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	14	2398	Boyle put in a shaky performance of "Memory" in the show's semi-finals last weekend, singing occasionally out of tune and out of time, and some fans on YouTube questioned whether she could handle the weight of expectations. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	15	2631	News media meanwhile reported some erratic behaviour over the past week, including how she had lost her temper in the foyer of the London hotel where she was staying. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	16	2807	Morgan, a tabloid journalism veteran who forged a friendship with Boyle, described her in his blog as a "frightened rabbit in headlights" and revealed she considered quitting the contest. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	17	3004	But his fellow judge Amanda Holden said after Saturday's performance: "I have never heard such powerful confident vocals." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	18	3136	Reports on Sunday suggested Boyle could strike it rich if she capitalises on her global success, with the News of the World saying one of the show's judges, music promoter Simon Cowell, had big plans for her. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	19	3354	"It's the biggest phenomenon I've ever seen out of any of my shows," Cowell -- a household name in the United States as a judge on "American Idol" -- told the newspaper. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	20	3533	Asked on television about her plans, Boyle said: "I hope to get an album out -- I'll just play it by ear. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0330	21	3639	What a journey -- unbelievable, and very humbling.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	1	189	The rebel Georgian region of South Ossetia voted Sunday in polls that could secure the grip of its separatist leader nine months after it was the subject of war between Russia and Georgia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	2	387	The local opposition says Eduard Kokoity is seeking to use the legislative elections to forge a loyal parliamentary majority to push through an amendment allowing him to run again for office when his second term lapses next year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	3	626	Russia -- which outraged the West by recognizing South Ossetia as independent in the wake of August's war with Georgia  --- has said South Ossetia should not amend the existing term limits in its constitution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	4	845	Four parties are competing for the 34 seats in the parliament, but the central election commission has barred the only two parties not loyal to Kokoity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	5	1007	Opposition activities said voting would not make a difference. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	6	1070	"I plan to sit at home. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	7	1094	There's nothing we can do," said Alan Gassiyev, an opposition leader, calling the polls "completely illegal." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	8	1213	"It's too bad if he wants to change the constitution," added Grigory Dzassokhov, a 55-year old former history teacher. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	9	1332	"It would be nonsense. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	10	1355	What kind of democracy is that?" 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	11	1397	Critics accuse Kokoity, an ex-wrestling champion, of muzzling opponents and stealing the money sent from Russia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	12	1519	As the region scrambles to rebuild itself in the aftermath of the war, the opposition accuses Kokoity and his circle of diverting lorries carrying construction material and humanitarian aid to traffic the goods in Russia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	13	1750	Out of over 10 billion rubles (320 million dollars, 230 million euros) in aid money budgeted by Moscow, South Ossetian authorities say they have spent just 1.5 billion rubles. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	14	1935	Kokoity -- who built connections in Moscow working as a trade official for the rebel region when it was known as a highway for smuggling in the early 1990s -- has rejected accusations against him as Georgian propaganda. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	15	2164	Speaking to reporters on Sunday, he pledged that the vote would be carried out strictly in accordance with law, saying the polls were "a maturity test for the small independent state." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	16	2358	"At 10:00 am I can already say there's a very high turnout," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	17	2429	Officials said it already amounted to 19 percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	18	2488	Eighty-eight polling stations have been set up for the region's 50,000 residents as well as additional sites in Russia for expatriates and refugees from the fighting. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	19	2664	Kokoity currently does not have the two-thirds of seats in the parliament to amend the constitution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	20	2774	And as the looming political scandal in the region threatens to become an embarrassment for Moscow, there are signs that the Kremlin is scaling back its support for the South Ossetian leader. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	21	2975	Sergey Naryshkin, the head of the Russian presidential administration, said on Russian television this month that South Ossetia should not amend the existing term limits in its constitution. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	22	3175	Moscow and Tbilisi fought a brief but intense war last August over the region, which had enjoyed de facto independence since the early 1990s thanks to tacit Russian support. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	23	3358	Following the conflict Russia formally recognised the region as independent, a move followed only by Nicaragua. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0331	24	3479	Russia took formal control of guarding its borders this month, in a move condemned by the West as a violation of an EU-brokered ceasefire that ended the fighting last August.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	5	1015	The ensuing shoot-out killed both Hamas men, three Palestinian policemen and a civilian. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	6	1104	A curfew was imposed on the town near the border with Israel following the incident, police said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	7	1211	Hamas, which has been at odds with the Fatah movement of the Palestinian Authority president Mahmud Abbas ever since the Islamists seized control of Gaza in 2007, lashed out over the incident. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	8	1413	"Hamas puts the complete responsibility of this ugly crime on Abbas and his security forces," Hamas said in a statement released in Gaza, adding that Samman had been wanted by Israel for six years. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	9	1611	"This crime is a red line." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	10	1648	Describing Abbas and his forces as agents of arch-enemy Israel, Hamas warned it would respond "with acts," without elaborating. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	11	1776	"Hamas will examine its options concerning this collaborator gang responsible for this crime." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	12	1880	Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhum said there was no chance of further reconciliation talks between the rivals following the "escalation by security services of Abu Mazen and Fatah against Hamas and its leaders in the West Bank." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	13	2113	"Fatah should choose -- dialogue with us or doing the dirty work of the Zionist enemy," Barhum said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0332	14	2223	The two factions have been divided since June 2007, when Hamas booted Abbas's secular Fatah party out of Gaza, leaving him in control only in the occupied West Bank.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0334	1	174	Croatians cast ballots on Sunday in a second round of local and regional elections, including to elect a mayor for the capital Zagreb, in voting expected to be influenced by the economic crisis. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0334	2	378	The elections are seen as a test of the country's governing coalition's ability to handle the effects of the global economic crisis, which sent the Adriatic country into recession in late 2008. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0334	3	581	Some four million voters were being asked to elect 221 mayors and municipal heads.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0334	10	1428	The conservatives lost the mayoral post in the country's second biggest town of Split, on the Adriatic coast, where an SDP candidate is to face an independent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0334	11	1597	Local analysts said the vote confirmed that the SDP and left bloc dominate in more developed parts of Croatia as well as in cities, while the HDZ and right- wing parties are more popular in less developed and rural areas. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0334	12	1828	The polls give voters the right for the first time to directly elect mayors, county prefects and municipal heads, along with 21 county assemblies and more than 550 city and town councils.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0335	1	177	Vietnam has recorded its first case of swine flu after a man tested positive for the virus, the health ministry said Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0335	2	311	"It is the first patient of the virus A(H1N1) in Vietnam," Nguyen Huy Nga, the ministry's spokesman, told AFP, adding the case was "confirmed officially by our ministry this morning."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	1	187	The once mighty US auto industry faces a day of reckoning on Monday with the looming bankruptcy of General Motors and an expected court ruling on the sale of Chrysler to a group led by Italy's Fiat. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	2	395	The global economic crisis has hit the US industry hard, prompting massive intervention by President Barack Obama's administration to prevent total collapse and a new blow to the nation's economy, which is already in recession. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	3	632	A government rescue plan for GM could put as much as 72.5 percent of the country's biggest automaker under state ownership. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	4	765	With the hours counting down for GM, company bondholders with slightly more than 50 percent of GM’s 27.2 billion dollars in bond debt voted Saturday in support of the restructuring plan, The New York Times reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	5	990	Under the plan, the bondholders would obtain the rights to buy an extra 15 percent of GM's stock at a low price. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	6	1103	They would also control 25 percent of the new GM, after having supported the new company's creation in bankruptcy court. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	7	1233	Recalcitrant bondholders who opt for confrontation rather than cooperation "will get nothing or very little," an Obama administration official told reporters Thursday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	8	1410	Government-backed restructuring in bankruptcy court for GM, once the world's largest automaker, appeared all but certain. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	9	1541	Monday marks a deadline imposed by the Obama administration for the company to submit a viable restructuring plan or file for bankruptcy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	10	1688	Meanwhile, a US bankruptcy court judge in New York was widely expected to approve a deal between Chrysler and Fiat on Monday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	11	1823	The third biggest US automaker has declared bankruptcy and is seeking a tie-up with Fiat in a plan presented as the only way to save the company from liquidation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	12	1995	Developments at Chrysler could provide an example for restructuring at GM, which will similarly have to sell some of its brands and close many dealerships. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	13	2160	But the administration official said a 60- to 90-day timeframe was "better" for GM, contrasted with the fast-track process for Chrysler, which filed for bankruptcy protection on April 30. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	14	2357	"This is a much more complicated company than Chrysler, as a global company. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	15	2434	It's three times the size," noted the official. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	16	2491	The United Auto Workers (UAW) union said Friday its members ratified a deal to allow GM to radically cut costs and its debt load, clearing the way for a quick exit from the expected bankruptcy filing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	17	2701	GM also announced plans to retool an idled US plant to build small cars it had originally planned to import, and two more US assembly plants could  potentially be saved. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	18	2880	The automaker, which normally shuts downs plants for two weeks during the summer, is planning longer-than-normal closures at a variety of facilities this summer, The Detroit Free Press reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	19	3084	Some factories will be shut down for as long as nine weeks, according to the newspaper report. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	20	3179	This week, about eight out of its 15 assembly plants will be running. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	21	3258	The bankruptcy filing could also be sped up by a deal struck Saturday after marathon talks that saw Canadian parts maker Magna and its Russian backers taking over GM's Opel. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	22	3441	The deal for GM's European operations, brokered by the German government, amounted to a major development in the remaking of the global auto industry. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	23	3601	GM employs some 50,000 people throughout Europe and Magna plans to cut about a fifth. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	24	3696	German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose government agreed to stump billions of euros (dollars) in loan guarantees and emergency loans to keep the ailing Opel afloat, acknowledged that talks over the future of GM Europe had sometimes been difficult. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	25	3953	Germany's Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck had even denounced what he called "scandalous" US negotiating tactics. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	26	4077	Yet despite what she called "huge mismanagement" by GM executives, a telephone call to Obama helped seal the deal, Merkel said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	27	4214	As for Chrysler, a new company could be born within days of approval for bankruptcy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	28	4299	The Treasury said it had transferred 6.9 billion dollars in public funds to New Carco, a newly created company to acquire Chrysler's "good assets." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	29	4456	If presiding judge Arthur Gonzalez rules against Chrysler, it faces a grim future, with a worst-case scenario being Fiat abandoning the tie-up and the US automaker going into liquidation, with massive job losses. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	30	4678	Legal appeals were expected if Gonzalez ruled in favor, meaning possible new delays. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0336	31	4763	Fiat has said it might back out if the transaction is not completed by June 15.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	1	193	Sri Lanka appealed Sunday for international support in dismantling the global political network of the Tamil Tiger rebels after declaring a full military victory over the separatist movement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	2	394	Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama told a high-level security forum in Singapore that Colombo needed help in disabling the Tigers' "powerful political lobbies in certain capitals" that are seeking to resurrect the movement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	3	629	"It is important for the international community to take all measures to assist the government of Sri Lanka, to track down the global network of the LTTE," Bogollagama said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	4	812	Speaking at the forum organised by the International Institute of Strategic Studies, Bogollagama also rejected allegations of genocide in the last days of the Sri Lankan military's battle against the LTTE. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	5	1027	"This was both fictional and well-fabricated, with ulterior and sinister motives in order to discredit the armed forces as well as to embarrass the government of Sri Lanka," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	6	1219	There have been allegations that large numbers of civilians had been killed as the Sri Lankan army closed in on the rebels to end the decades-long war. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	7	1380	Rights group Amnesty International on Saturday called for an independent probe into the number of civilian deaths. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	8	1504	A day earlier, The Times of London newspaper had cited what it said were confidential UN reports stating that more than 20,000 civilians were killed by Sri Lankan army shelling. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	9	1691	But Bogollagama said the campaign to crush the rebels was a model for others to follow. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	10	1788	"Sri Lanka will, no doubt, enter the annals of history as a classic textbook example of a nation that successfully prevailed over the scourge of terrorism, whilst tenaciously upholding the cherished values of democracy and human rights that have been deeply engraved in the psyche of our people," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	11	2103	The LTTE's fall would also strike a blow to international terrorism, the minister said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	12	2200	"The elimination of the LTTE from Sri Lanka as a terror organisation would prevent other facets of terrorism, such as money laundering, narcotics trafficking, human smuggling, arms smuggling, and other means of terrorist networking the world over ..." he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	13	2470	Bogollagama also emphasised the importance of the immediate post-war actions taken by the government. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	14	2581	"This post-conflict phase is crucial in restoring confidence in people. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	15	2653	We know these chances won't come all the time, and some chances only come once, and this is one such chance that we have got, and we will not miss out on this opportunity." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	16	2835	He said the rehabilitation and resettlement of the 280,000 refugees displaced by the conflict was one of the key priorities of the Sri Lankan government, promising they would be treated fairly. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	17	3038	"The government is firmly committed to reaching a political settlement acceptable to all... 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	18	3130	We'll have an inclusive process in this regard, and we'll have everyone who is conscious of our country onboard irrespective whatever ethnic identity one might have by birth." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0337	19	3315	The LTTE launched a bloody campaign in 1972 to create a Tamil homeland in the Sinhalese-majority island.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	1	184	Indian students rallied in Melbourne on Sunday as Australia scrambled to contain outrage over a wave of attacks that has seen it labelled racist and strained diplomatic relations with New Delhi. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	2	388	What began as a local policing issue in Australia's second largest city has spiralled into a crisis that prompted talks between Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh on student safety last week. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	3	618	Students and Indian officials are demanding action after more than 70 assaults on their peers in a year in Melbourne, including at least four in the past fortnight, attracting prominent coverage in newspapers here and in India. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	4	855	Pictures from a hospital bed of a comatose Sravan Kumar Theerthala, who was stabbed with a screwdriver by gatecrashers at a party, were splashed across front pages in India. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	5	1029	A teenager faces charges of attempted murder. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	6	1084	"They were saying, 'Don't touch us you Indians' and 'Indians go home' before they got the screwdriver," said Theerthala's friend, Jayasanka Bagpelli. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	7	1243	Another student, Baljinder Singh, told last week how his attackers laughed as he pleaded with them during a robbery at a Melbourne train station. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	8	1398	"I was saying to them, 'I'm giving you all my money, don't kill me, don't kill me'," said Singh, who was stabbed and left with a six-inch (15-centimetre) wound to his stomach and has advised Indians to stay away from Australia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	9	1635	Indian media have dubbed the attacks "curry bashings", a term reportedly used by youths behind the violence in Melbourne's western suburbs, where 30 percent of assault victims are Indian. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	10	1832	It is a grossly disproportionate figure in a city of almost four million with an Indian student population of less than 50,000. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	11	1969	Police deny any racial element to the attacks, arguing Indian students were often simply in the wrong place at the wrong time as they travelled home late with items such as mobile phones and MP3 players. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	12	2182	But Indian High Commissioner to Australia Sujatha Singh said racism was playing a part, even if some of the crimes were "opportunistic". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	13	2328	Federation of Indian Students president Amit Menghani, who led the rally of more than 1,000 supporters through central Melbourne Sunday, said the police attitude had frustrated students. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	14	2524	Bagpelli, who attended the rally, added: "It's only because the Indian government is now applying pressure that they are doing anything." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	15	2671	While the attacks are unlikely to result in any permanent damage at a diplomatic level, Canberra is concerned parents in India may prevent their children studying in Australia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	16	2857	That would threaten the international education sector here, a 15.5 billion dollar (12.2 billion US) a year industry that has attracted more than 90,000 Indians nationwide. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	17	3039	More broadly, with headlines such as "Australia, land of racism" running in overseas media, there are also fears Australia's reputation for tolerance is sustaining long-term damage. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	18	3230	"We need to help make sure that the mothers and fathers of all students who come here are assured that Australia is a safe location to come to, that our general crime rates and violence rates are very low," Foreign Minister Stephen Smith told commercial television Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	19	3512	There are already signs the controversy is souring popular attitudes in India towards Australia, with Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan threatening to snub the offer of an honorary doctorate from an Australian university. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	20	3743	"My conscience is profoundly unsettled at the moment," Bachchan said on his blog, in which he also reported an "overwhelming" response from the Indian public over the issue. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	21	3926	Theerthala's assault proved the catalyst for widespread anger in India, sparking a flurry of high-level diplomatic activity and strong public statements from Indian officials indicating they had run out of patience. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0338	22	4151	"Such attacks cannot be allowed to happen," High Commissioner Singh said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	1	185	The All Blacks selectors Sunday named a largely predictable squad for their opening Tests of the year and then delivered a stinging criticism of their defensive performance in the Super 14. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	2	384	The 26-man squad for two Tests against France and one against Italy next month includes only three new caps. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	3	493	Veteran fullback Mils Muliaina takes over the captaincy, replacing the injured Richie McCaw. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	4	595	It was the one bright spot for Muliaina in an otherwise dismal weekend with the All Blacks named just hours after he led his Waikato Chiefs to an inglorious 17-61 defeat by the Northern Bulls in the Super 14 final. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	5	819	But head coach Graham Henry maintained that game had no bearing on the All Blacks squad which, with several big names sidelined by injury, was finalised a week ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	6	993	In addition to McCaw, loose forwards Rodney So'oialo and Scott Waldrom, wing Sitiveni Sivivatu, lock Anthony Boric, scrumhalf Andy Ellis, hooker Corey Flynn and flyhalf Daniel Carter were also not considered. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	7	1211	Two other injured players, scrumhalf Brendon Leonard and lock Ali Williams, have been selected but are unlikely to be considered for the first Test against France. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0340	8	1384	With the exception of the three new internationals -- prop Wyatt Crockett, lock Isaac Ross and loose forward Tanerau Latimer -- the selectors have stayed loyal to players with proven Test experience.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	1	195	Cancer specialists, gathered for an annual meeting, are reporting progress in the fight against lung cancer, the most common and deadliest form of cancer, but little progress in treating colorectal cancer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	2	410	Doctors and researchers at the 45th gathering of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) -- the world's main cancer conference -- on Saturday learned of two studies showing progress in the battle against lung cancer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	3	645	The first study showed how the combination of two anti-cancer treatments following standard chemotherapy can slow the advance of lung cancer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	4	796	Patients treated with a combination of Tarceva, sold by the Swiss drugmaker Roche, and Avastin, a drug by Roche's Genentech unit, saw their cancer growth slow more than a control group treated with Avastin. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	5	1012	More than 750 patients were randomized to receive Avastin and a placebo, or Avastin and Tarceva. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	6	1109	Those in the Tarceva group survived an average of 4.8 months before the cancer started growing again, compared to 3.7 months for the control group, said Vincent Miller, the study's main author. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	7	1312	The numbers translated to a 29 percent reduced risk of disease progression for patients who took a combination of Tarceva and Avastin. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	8	1456	"This is the first study to show that adding erlotinib (Tarceva) to maintenance therapy with bevacizumab (Avastin) delays disease progression in patients who have already received bevacizumab as part of their initial chemotherapy," said Miller. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	9	1710	A second study with 663 patients with advance lung cancer were given the drug Alimta, from US pharmaceutical Eli Lilly, which blocks cell growth. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	10	1865	Preliminary results showed that patients who took the drug lived 26 percent longer compared to a control group that took a placebo: 13.4 months against 10.6 months. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	11	2039	As in the first study, all the patients had already received four standard chemotherapy sessions. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	12	2146	"This study will change the overall standard of care," said Chandra Belani, the deputy director of the Penn State Cancer Institute, as she presented the research. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	13	2318	"Maintenance therapy with Alimta (permetrexed) offers a new paradigm for patients who have advanced lung cancer, because it has a low toxicity and can be given on an ongoing basis over a prolonged period of time to extend patients' lives," she said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	14	2577	However there were few advances to report in the fight against colorectal cancer, the fourth most common in the United States and the second deadliest type of cancer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	15	2753	Research on 2,710 patients with Phase Three colorectal cancer taking the drug Avastine along with standard chemotherapy treatment showed no difference in the survival rate or the recurrence of the tumor after three and a half years when compared to those not taking the drug. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0341	16	3038	Another study conducted in Italy among 747 patients with advanced colorectal cancer showed that the drug Eloxatine from the French firm Sanofi did not reduce the size of the tumor when combined with standard treatment used ahead of cancer surgery.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	1	189	US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner makes his first trip to Beijing Sunday, exploiting his early links with China to steer relations with the Asian giant under President Barack Obama's watch. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	2	393	Having started on the wrong foot by criticizing China for currency manipulation, Geithner will now have to grapple with issues ranging from key Chinese holdings of dollar based assets to the global economic turmoil when he meets President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao and others during his visit. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	3	700	But analysts are confident that his previous Chinese connections will come a long way to establishing links with the leadership in Beijing as the Obama administration banks on China's credit to bankroll the recession-struck US economy and its growing influence to help ease the global economic crisis. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	4	1011	This despite the fact that he lacks the firm business background of his predecessor, Henry Paulson, reputedly the most well-connected post-war Treasury Secretary, having travelled extensively to Beijing as a private banker. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	5	1244	"Yes, he doesn't quite have the same business background as that of Mr. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	6	1316	Paulson but I think Mr Geithner will turn that to his advantage," said Nicholas Lardy, a China expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	7	1496	"I think quite frankly that Mr. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	8	1528	Geithner will be a better listener with the Chinese," he said, citing Paulson's sometimes "very strong advice" to the Chinese on reforming the financial system. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	9	1698	"Now they recognize that what Paulson was advocating did not turn up so well," Lardy added.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	14	2486	His father Peter Geithner was also the first representative in Beijing for the Ford Foundation, possibly the oldest US non-government organization in China. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	15	2652	Obama administration officials took pains to emphasize the Treasury chief's Chinese connections at a media briefing before his departure from Washington Saturday for his two day Beijing visit beginning Monday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	16	2871	Geithner would deliver a speech at Peking university, his alma mater, during the trip and "will meet with students and with professors and we hope with some former professors of his," one official said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	17	3083	He would also visit the offices of the Ford Foundation, which has funded economics education in the United States of a large group of Chinese who are now senior officials, academics and members of the economic establishment in Beijing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	18	3328	"Coincidentally, the Ford Foundation was established by secretary Geithner's father," the official said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	19	3442	Despite his history with China, Geithner created a stir at his confirmation hearing in January when he said in a written reply to a senator that Obama "believes that China is manipulating its currency." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	20	3654	It triggered a storm in China and signaled that Obama will take the Chinese head on over the currency manipulation charges. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	21	3787	But Obama administration officials swiftly moved to contain the damage, saying the reply was written by midlevel staff helping Geithner answer the plethora of questions from senators. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	22	3980	On taking office, Geithner also rapidly reached out to the Chinese. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	23	4057	"I have talked to my counterparts in China over the past few months much more than I’ve talked to my counterparts from any other country," he told the New York Times in a recent interview. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	24	4255	In Beijing however Geithner faces the tough task of convincing the Chinese to maintain their massive US bond holdings under threat by burgeoning US debt and prodding them to make their their currency more flexible. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0342	25	4479	Being the top holder of the bonds, China is the largest creditor to the United States aside from being the world's largest holder of US dollars as a reserve currency, at nearly two trillion dollars.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0343	1	175	President Barack Obama will journey to the center of Arab-Muslim civilization this week, to begin the daunting task of draining deep mistrust of the United States felt across the Islamic world. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0343	2	378	In Egypt on Thursday, Obama will make a personal address to the world's Muslims, harnessing his own ancestral ties to Islam and globalizing his message of change in an speech rich in trademark political ambition. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0343	3	600	Obama's trip next week to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and World War II commemorations in France and Germany, comes as some observers scent a moment of opportunity amid the perpetual Middle East crisis. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0343	4	803	But others see only peril, with a showdown gathering pace between Washington and Israel over Jewish settlements and no end in sight to Iran's nuclear drive. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0343	5	969	Obama targeted reconcilation with Islam and rigorous Middle East diplomacy from his first moments in office. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0343	6	1087	"To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect," Obama said in his inaugural address in January.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0343	11	1791	Obama may try to use the charismatic rhetoric which helped make him president as a balm for region-wide mistrust of the United States. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0343	12	1935	"I want to use the occasion to deliver a broader message about how the United States can change for the better its relationship with the Muslim world," Obama said last week. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0343	13	2118	The speech will also be a promise kept -- way back in the presidential campaign Obama pledged to speak before a major Islamic forum. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0343	14	2260	In major speeches, Obama embroiders his exotic personal biography into a a political narrative -- as in his frank 2008 speech about race.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	15	1923	But only the European Union (EU), which has set its own reduction of 20 percent by 2020, deepened to 30 percent if other advanced economies play ball, is anywhere near such a figure. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	16	2115	After eight long years of vilification, the United States is now being warmly embraced in the climate arena as Barack Obama bulldozes George W. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	17	2259	Bush's policies. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	18	2285	But Washington is also warning that the world cannot expect miracles. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	19	2364	A bill put before Congress would cut US emissions by 17 percent by 2020 over 2005 levels using a cap-and-trade system of the kind Bush loathed. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	20	2517	This approach would translate to a reduction of only four percent compared to the 1990 benchmark, but it would also ratchet up to 83 percent by 2050, the top US climate change negotiator, Todd Stern, said in Paris last week. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	21	2751	"We are jumping as high as the political system will tolerate," said Stern, characterising China's demand of a 40 percent cut by 2020 as "not realistic". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	22	2914	Just as unresolved is what the emerging giant countries should do. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	23	2990	The draft should at least "call for those wealthier, more capable countries to take actions," said Stern's deputy, Jonathan Pershing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	24	3133	China is now the world's No. 1 polluter, and Brazil and India have also leapt up the emission ranks as their economies have grown. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	25	3273	Yet all refuse binding emissions targets of the kind that apply only to rich countries under the Kyoto Protocol, the UNFCCC treaty to be superseded from 2013 by the Copenhagen accord. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	26	3466	Then there is how to muster finance to help poor countries adapt to the impacts of climate change, and how to transfer clean technology so that they avoid becoming the greenhouse-gas villains of the future. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	27	3682	Keya Chatterjee, deputy director of the climate change programme with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) said emerging countries were thirsting for the energy switch. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	28	3853	"It's sort of a green arms race where everybody wants to have access to clean- energy industry," she said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	29	3960	"That's a pretty huge change in the negotiations that will affect the dynamics." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	30	4050	Even so, she said, developing countries were suspicious. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	31	4107	"This lack of trust comes from a long tradition of industrialised countries not living up to their obligations." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	32	4229	These are just a few of the many obstacles besetting the Bali Road Map. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	33	4310	The complexity is such that many experts now predict Copenhagen will not be a complete treaty but, at best, a good deal on the main points. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0346	34	4459	"I think that what we are looking at in Copenhagen is a deal that will lock in some specific emission reductions goals, will create commitments both for investment and adaptation and then... the details will have to be filled in later," said Angela Anderson of the US Climate Action Network (CAN). 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	0	58	US and Russia hold second round of START arms talks 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	1	183	Russian and US negotiators are due to meet in Geneva on Monday for a second round of talks on renewing a key Cold War-era arms reduction deal, a month before their leaders hold a landmark summit. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	2	388	Diplomats said the three day meeting on the START treaty would be held behind closed doors at an undisclosed location, mirroring the discretion surrounding the first round in Moscow nearly two weeks ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	3	601	"On the details of the negotiation, I think we prefer to keep that in private right now. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	4	690	I think that's just the best way to conduct these kinds of negotiations," US State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said in Washington. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	5	833	First results from the talks are expected to be unveiled by Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev during their summit meeting in Moscow on July 6 to 8, a Russian diplomat said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	6	1025	Despite a thaw in US-Russian relations following the departure of the Bush administration, analysts were expecting little concrete progress on the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which expires on December 5. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	7	1248	On top of the complex technical issues surrounding the landmark treaty -- which took a decade to reach agreement on the deep cuts in US and Soviet nuclear arsenals after the fall of the Iron Curtain -- the negotiations are also hampered by differing ambitions. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	8	1518	"The sides are not in the same position. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	9	1559	Obama needs a result to demonstrate that the 'reset' of US-Russian relations is getting somewhere," said Evgeny Volk of the Heritage Foundation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	10	1713	Earlier this year, Vice President Joseph Biden unveiled the Obama administration's fresh approach to fractious US relations with the old Cold War foe, saying it wanted to press the 'reset' button. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	11	1919	Disarmament expert Jozef Goldblat said the START talks allowed the United States to create a climate "propitious for help with other more complicated subjects" where Washington needs Moscow's support, such as Iran and North Korea's controversial nuclear programmes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	12	2194	However, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has not concealed Moscow's desire to broaden the talks to take account of the planned US anti-missile shield in Europe. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	13	2371	The United States has insisted that the defensive shield is meant to counter an Iranian threat. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	14	2476	But Russia regards the shield, which would partly be based in former eastern bloc countries close to its borders, as a threat to its own security. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	15	2632	"The number one stumbling block is the anti missile shield," said Volk. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	16	2704	"Moscow wants Washington to give up deployment but the Americans are against that." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	17	2797	Russian military analyst Alexander Goltz said the negotiations also helped Moscow recover some of its prestige. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	18	2918	"The Russians are aiming to make the process last as long as possible, because the talks restore their status as a world power," he explained. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	19	3070	Russian officials hailed the "constructive and business-like" atmosphere of the first round, but US delegation chief Rose Gottemoeller warned before the talks even began that the process could be more drawn out than expected. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	20	3305	Goltz played down expectations for the Obama-Medvedev summit because the two sides were too far apart. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0347	21	3417	But veteran disarmament observer Goldblat suggested an elegant way out: a five year extension of START that would give time for negotiations on a "broader" disarmament deal between the world's biggest nuclear powers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	0	58	Major security plan drawn up for Lebanon vote: minister 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	1	187	Lebanon will deploy 50,000 police and soldiers to prevent any outbreak of violence during the June 7 parliamentary election as part of a major security plan, Interior Minister Ziad Baroud has said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	2	394	"We will have 30,000 police and soldiers deployed at polling stations and their vicinity and 20,000 other police and soldiers deployed elsewhere nationwide," Baroud told AFP in an interview. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	3	594	He said the plan takes into account sensitive regions where violence could erupt on election day between members of the current Western-backed ruling majority and supporters of the Hezbollah-led opposition alliance, which is backed by Iran and Syria. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	4	854	Sectarian violence between the two sides left around 100 people dead last May when Hezbollah staged a spectacular takeover of mainly Sunni parts of west Beirut, prompting fears of a new civil war. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	5	1060	Baroud said security measures on election day had taken into account the risk of violence in each of the 26 electoral districts. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	6	1198	"In some districts there is minimal risk and in others it's more serious," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	7	1282	"And it's according to the risk factor that troops will be deployed." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	8	1361	For example, he said there was little likelihood of violence erupting in most of the regions in southern Lebanon where Hezbollah and its allies are assured victory. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	9	1535	However, the situation is expected to be more tense in regions where the vote is set to be tight, including the southern coastal town of Sidon and in the eastern Bekaa valley town of Zahle. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	10	1734	Baroud said he was nonetheless optimistic the vote would proceed smoothly, noting that there had been few security incidents in the run-up to the election. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	11	1899	"Of course, I am anxious ... but the political situation (locally and regionally) is more reassuring than alarming," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	12	2034	"It's up to the country's political factions and every Lebanese man or woman to ensure there is no outbreak of violence." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	13	2165	Baroud, 39, a widely popular minister in the current 30-member national unity government in which Hezbollah is represented, said measures had also been adopted to prevent fraud at the 5,200 polling stations. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	14	2382	The vote this year for the first time is taking place on a single day rather than over a month-long period. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	15	2499	"We have taken anti-fraud measures including placing transparent boxes in polling stations, more secrecy of voting and we have adopted international standards," Baroud said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	16	2682	"Also the indelible ink we will be using will prevent someone from voting twice." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	17	2773	Some 2,200 national observers and 250 international monitors will oversee the vote including from the European Union, the Carter Center, the Arab League and several countries. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	18	2958	The 128 seats in parliament are divided equally between Christians and Muslims. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	19	3047	Baroud said he expected final results to be announced on June 8, barring any major security incidents or fraud. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0348	20	3168	"I am crossing my fingers on a daily basis," he said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0351	1	180	South Korea may cancel a shipment of steel to North Korea for power plant repairs in protest at its nuclear test, which sparked international condemnation, a report said Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0351	2	367	Seoul is considering auctioning off the steel plates, which have been kept at a state warehouse, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0351	3	516	"We cannot ship steel plates because of North Korea's nuclear test," an unnamed foreign ministry official was quoted as saying.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0352	1	185	Myanmar on Sunday accused opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi of deliberately covering up the presence of an American man in her home and warned foreign governments against interfering in the case. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0352	2	391	"It is no doubt that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has committed a cover-up of the truth by her failure to report an illegal immigrant to the authorities concerned," Major General Aye Myint, Myanmar's deputy defence minister, told a security forum in Singapore.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0352	11	1508	"Countries should refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of Myanmar that will affect peace and security of the region," said Aye Myint. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0352	12	1663	Critics say Myanmar's military regime trumped up the charges in a bid to keep her locked up ahead of elections in 2010, as the latest six-year period of her house arrest expired on Wednesday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0352	13	1864	"Solving one's internal affairs through its legal system with legal proceedings in accordance with law does not amount to the threat of peace or breach of security of the region," Aye Myint said in an apparent reaction to criticism from other participants at the Singapore forum.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0354	1	194	Pakistan's defence secretary said Sunday that a month-long offensive to crush Taliban fighters in the northwest could end within days, as security forces hunted down the militant leadership. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0354	2	394	Swat valley's main town Mingora is back in government hands, the military announced late Saturday, and Syed Athar Ali told a security forum in Singapore that three targeted northwest districts were almost clear of Taliban rebels. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0354	3	633	"Operations in Swat, Buner and adjoining areas have almost met complete success," the secretary of defence said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0354	5	901	The army remains locked in battle in some areas, but the fall of Mingora was a critical milestone in an offensive launched after the Taliban thrust to within 100 kilometres (60 miles) of Islamabad. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0354	6	1108	Washington, which is firmly backing the military drive, had warned that the rebels threatened Pakistan's very existence and identified the country and neighbouring Afghanistan as central to its 'war on terror'. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0354	7	1328	"We are trying to target the top leadership of militants and they are constantly being followed," chief military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said as he announced the Mingora win. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0354	8	1524	Officials said lower-ranking leaders had been killed but it was harder to get to the top leaders, who had a network of hardcore militants around them and had slipped into the rugged mountain terrain.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	1	187	A Swedish party which wants an Internet filesharing free-for-all, the Pirate Party, could become one of the surprise new entrants to the European parliament this week. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	2	364	The party, which also wants to beef up Internet privacy, was founded in January 2006 and quickly attracted members angered by controversial laws adopted in the Scandinavian country that criminalised filesharing and authorised monitoring of emails. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	3	621	Its membership shot up after a Stockholm court on April 17 sentenced four Swedes to a year in jail for running one of the world's biggest filesharing sites, The Pirate Bay.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	20	3037	"There is always someone (from the party) online, even at 2:00 or 4:00 in the morning," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	21	3144	Many members say they joined not only because they are die-hard fans of the Internet and filesharing, but because they fear a "Big Brother" society. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	22	3302	"Sweden was built on protecting the freedom of its citizens. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	23	3363	This pact is now disappearing," said Levinsen. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	24	3419	"They want to impose controls on what we're saying, like in China or in North Korea. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0359	25	3504	We're not there yet, but we're on the way," said Robert Nyberg, a 29 -year-old demolition worker clad in a purple tee-shirt bearing the party's black flag.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	1	160	The outfits are still elegant, the heels still vertiginous, but Rachida Dati's flashing smile seems just a little more forced since she found out she was being exiled to the European parliament. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	2	364	For the 42-year-old Dati, a virtually guaranteed victory in the EU election is seen as proof of the justice minister's dramatic fall from President Nicolas Sarkozy's good graces. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	3	552	Once her seat in the EU parliament is confirmed after France's vote on June 7, Dati, the first French minister from North African immigrant stock, will have to resign from Sarkozy's government. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	4	755	"I had the immense honour of being the justice minister, so I'm not going to be bitter about it," Dati said in a television interview, warning: "They won't get rid of me like that!" 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	5	946	Having risen to power as Sarkozy's devoted aide, she will now have to launch into electoral politics away from her natural habitat in the glittering salons of the Parisian elite. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	6	1134	Mocked by opponents as a lightweight, Dati was all steel and seriousness at a recent electoral meeting in a well-heeled western Paris suburb. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	7	1285	She replied with poise to questions from the crowd, many drawn to the event more by her celebrity status and reputation for gaffes than by enthusiasm for the European parliament election. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	8	1482	"Rachida Dati lacks neither skill nor determination," said analyst Philippe Braud. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	9	1565	"She can bounce back. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	10	1587	She has political trump cards: she represents ethnic diversity, she's a fighter and she fascinates the media." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	11	1707	Dati, a lawyer by training who became an advisor and spokeswoman for Sarkozy, was an outsider without political experience when he made her justice minister after his 2007 election triumph. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	12	1906	Dati, with her rags to riches background, and other surprise female picks added energy to the line up, and Sarkozy was visibly proud of her. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	13	2056	She threw herself into an ambitious programme to reform the French legal system, closely following promises made by the president, but antagonised a generation of magistrates and ministerial aides with her domineering style. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	14	2290	A close friend of Sarkozy's second wife, Cecilia, she became a regular feature in celebrity magazines and gossip columns, gaining a reputation for her couture outfits and jet set parties. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	15	2487	Eyebrows were also raised when the government was forced to confirm that the justice ministry had overspent its 200,000-euro (272,000-dollar) annual entertainment budget after she hosted several luxury receptions. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	16	2710	Concerned that his protegee needed a power base of her own, Sarkozy had her parachuted into Paris' 7th district as mayor, and began to push for her to take on a more party political role. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	17	2907	But Dati's star slipped as magistrates demonstrated against her bid to streamline the court system and jail wardens against conditions said to have contributed to a spate of prison suicides. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	18	3107	Meanwhile, other changes were afoot. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	19	3144	Nicolas and Cecilia Sarkozy divorced and Dati has never been as close to his third wife, former super model Carla Bruni. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	20	3274	Dati's private life is also, in her own term, "complicated". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	21	3335	In January, she gave birth to a daughter, Zohra. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	22	3384	Her refusal to name the child's father has triggered a whirl of media speculation about his identity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	23	3495	She rushed back to work five days later, earning praise from some quarters as a role model for career women, but brickbats from those who thought her haste undermined the fight for generous maternity leave. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	24	3711	Nevertheless, despite Dati's display of unruffled commitment to his cause, Sarkozy took personal charge of the judicial reform agenda, in an early sign that he was tiring of his former ally. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	25	3911	Rather than sack her and call into question his own judgment in picking her, Sarkozy set about strong-arming her into the European campaign, which she had previously said she had no interest in. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	26	4115	The race began badly when a video of her giggling inanely and failing to answer questions on European policy at a youth event made the rounds of the Internet. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0360	27	4274	She has since showed more determination and ambition in the campaign.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	0	58	Europe's desperate bid to bring out voters 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	1	176	European leaders on Sunday stepped up a desperate battle to persuade people to vote for the unloved EU parliament this week, but the campaign has opened up new political divisions across the continent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	2	387	With polls indicating a record low turnout for the June 4-7 election, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a joint plea to voters, saying a strong parliament was essential to confront the economic crisis. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	3	640	The two said they want "a strong Europe that protects" its people and called for "all Europeans to vote" in the statement, published by the Journal du Dimanche newspaper in France and Die Welt am Sonntag in Germany. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	4	865	A "strong Europe does not necessarily mean more powers for the European Union, even more European legislation or even more financial means," said Merkel and Sarkozy who still called for "real European regulation" to tackle the financial crisis. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	5	1119	They said first steps "to assure real European regulation in the financial sector, based on coordination and cooperation between regulators" should be taken at the EU summit in June. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	6	1311	"For speculative funds, tax havens, payment for executives and financial traders, we want an exemplary Europe," the French and German leaders said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	7	1468	The pair also gave strong backing to the Lisbon reform treaty, deadlocked by Ireland's rejection in a referendum last year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	8	1601	"Europe must play a leading role in the world. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	9	1648	For that, it must have efficient institutions. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	10	1695	That is why we need the Lisbon Treaty," they said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	11	1755	Merkel and Sarkozy said they were ready to work on "political accord on guarantees for Ireland" at the June summit and they have "confidence in the Irish to choose Europe" when they hold a new referendum this year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	12	1979	The two also reaffirmed opposition to Turkey joining the EU, without naming the country. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	13	2068	"To be able to act, the EU needs frontiers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	14	2112	Unlimited enlargement is not possible." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	15	2161	The statement highlighted fears that the vote for the 736 member European assembly could prove a new embarrassment for the 27-nation EU. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	16	2307	There was a record 45 percent abstention at the last election in 2004.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	18	2512	In Britain, Poland and Romania, fewer than one in three people plan to vote, according to recent surveys. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	19	2627	In Spain, which has benefited enormously from EU funds, analysts expect turnout of 40 percent at best. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	20	2730	Portugal expects a record abstention rate. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	21	2782	The stakes are higher now however as the parliament is likely to win a bigger voice in decisions that affect the EU's 500 million population if the Lisbon treaty comes into force.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	25	3303	But in many countries the EU vote will be a test of the national governments in power.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	29	3983	Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt's conservative Moderates are also losing ground in the run-up to the elections, according to opinion poll released Saturday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0362	30	4158	The EPP is still expected to remain the biggest single party in the parliament, which already has a key role approving the EU budget and passing laws on a wide range of issues.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0369	2	352	The five-day exercise will simulate simultaneous rocket strikes from the Gaza Strip and Lebanon and missile attacks from arch-foes Syria and Iran and test the way rescue services deal with the attacks.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0371	1	176	Three Palestinian police officers, two Hamas militants and a civilian were killed during a shootout in the northern West Bank town of Qalqilya on Sunday, officials said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0371	2	355	The gunfight erupted when police tried to arrest Mohammad Yassin, a member of Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, who had barricaded himself in his house, Palestinian police said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0371	3	561	Yassin and another Hamas militant were killed along with three policemen and a civilian, they said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0371	4	670	A curfew was imposed on the town in the north of the occupied West Bank  near the border with Israel following the incident, police said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0371	5	817	Hamas, a bitter rival of the Fatah movement of Palestinian Authority president Mahmud Abbas, violently ousted Fatah from the Gaza Strip in June 2007, effectively limiting Abbas's rule to the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0372	1	197	Israel will not agree to US demands to freeze all settlement activity in the occupied West Bank, a minister close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0372	2	373	"I want to say in a crystal clear manner that the current Israeli government will not accept in any fashion that legal settlement activity in Judea and Samaria be frozen," said Transport Minister Yisrael Katz, using the Israeli term for the West Bank. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0372	3	634	"The government will defend the vital interests of the state of Israel," he told army radio. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0372	4	736	It was the first high-level reaction to a call by President Barack Obama on Thursday during a meeting with Palestinian counterpart Mahmud Abbas that Israel stop settlement activity, a key obstacle in the hobbled Middle East peace talks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0372	5	982	Although the international community considers all Israeli settlements illegal, Israel makes a distinction between those the government authorised and so-called wildcat outposts, set up by zealous settlers without state approval.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0373	0	58	Pakistan hunts Taliban leadership after Swat gain 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0373	1	193	Pakistan on Sunday pursued the Taliban leadership in the northwest after seizing the main town in Swat valley from the militants, as it continues its drive to flush out extremists. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0373	2	383	The business and administrative hub of Mingora was back in government hands, military officials announced late Saturday, more than a month after Islamabad began its blistering assault against advancing Taliban insurgents. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0373	3	614	The army is still fighting Taliban guerrillas, but the fall of Mingora is a critical milestone in an offensive across three northwest districts launched after the Taliban thrust to within 100 kilometres (60 miles) of Islamabad. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0373	4	851	Washington, which is firmly backing the military drive, had warned the rebels threatened Pakistan's very existence and identified the country and neighbouring Afghanistan as central to its 'war on terror'. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0373	5	1066	"We are trying to target the top leadership of militants and they are constantly being followed," chief military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said as he announced the Mingora win. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0373	6	1262	Officials said lower-ranking leaders had been killed but it was harder to get to the top leaders, who had a network of hardcore militants around them. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0373	7	1422	"They will be eliminated wherever we find them," said one military official, who did not wish to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media, adding that: "We believe that they are somewhere in the mountains." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0373	8	1653	Pakistan has slapped a 600,000-dollar price on the head of firebrand Swat Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah for masterminding the nearly two-year uprising in Swat valley to enforce sharia law. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0373	9	1857	The insurgency has transformed a scenic region once popular with Western tourists for its soaring peaks, pristine ski slopes and cool mountain air into a battle ground, with armed Taliban in April patrolling the streets of Mingora. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0373	10	2098	Fazlullah led thousands of supporters, a mixture of hardcore ideologues and disenfranchised young men, in a brutal campaign that beheaded opponents, burned scores of schools and fought against government troops since November 2007. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0373	11	2339	The government has also offered rewards for 21 rebel chiefs -- dead or alive -- from Swat, and on Thursday listed names and published mugshots. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0373	12	2492	Pakistan's northwestern capital Peshawar and the eastern cultural centre of Lahore have both been rocked by deadly explosions in the last five days, as fears grow that the Taliban is exacting revenge for the offensive. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0373	13	2720	A spokesman for Pakistan Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud -- who has a five- million-dollar bounty on his head posted by the United States -- had on Thursday claimed the suicide attack on a police building in Lahore. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0373	14	2944	Hakimullah Mehsud also warned of more "massive attacks" on government buildings to revenge the Swat military operation and in protest at Islamabad's close ties with Washington. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0373	15	3130	Baitullah Mehsud commands Tehreek-e-Taliban from the lawless tribal area of Waziristan on the Afghan border in the rugged mountains, where militants branded by Washington as the greatest terror threat to the West are holed up. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0373	16	3366	Nearly 2.4 million people have fled the fighting in the northwest and now huddle in refugee camps or with relatives, and as the crisis drags on analysts warn that public opinion against the offensive may sour. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0373	17	3585	The military said it had relaxed its strict curfew Sunday in most parts of the northwest including Mingora to allow people trapped on the roads as they tried to flee the offensive to return home or leave the region. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0373	18	3810	"The curfew will be relaxed from 6:00 am to 1:00 pm in Swat and Malakand," a statement issued by the military said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0374	1	187	Iranian security officials have defused a handmade bomb on board a domestic flight headed from Ahvaz, in the west of Iran, to the capital Tehran, Fars news agency reported on Sunday.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0374	8	1068	The province, which is home to Iran's Baluch minority who adhere to Sunni Islam, has been the scene of a deadly insurgency by a Sunni rebel group which is strongly opposed to the government of predominantly Shiite Iran. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0374	9	1297	The attack on the mosque was reminiscent of a similar outbreak of violence just days before Iran's last presidential election in 2005 which brought Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to power.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0375	1	196	Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan has  rejected an honorary doctorate from a Brisbane university to protest against a wave of attacks on Indian students in Australia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0375	2	372	"Under the prevailing circumstances I find it inappropriate at this juncture to accept this decoration," Bachchan said in a letter to the Queensland University of Technology posted on his blog Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0375	3	582	"My conscience is profoundly unsettled at the moment," the letter said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0375	4	663	Bachchan, 66, known as "The Big B" in movie-mad India, had used his blog to request fan feedback on whether he should accept the degree -- awarded for his contribution to the world of entertainment. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0375	5	871	He said he had been "overwhelmed" by the response. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0375	6	931	A series of attacks on Indian students has unleashed a furious reaction in India and strained diplomatic ties with Australia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0375	7	1066	Australian police have rejected claims that the attacks were racially motivated, saying the students were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0375	8	1226	India has said it is "closely monitoring" the situation, while Australia's High Commissioner in New Delhi, John McCarthy, sought to defend his country's reputation Sunday and allay fears that foreign students were in danger.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	1	191	Myanmar democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi has accused the ruling junta of "bullying" after authorities entered her home without permission while she is in prison facing trial, her party said Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	2	397	Officials took US national John Yettaw to her lakeside house last week to stage a reconstruction, for the purposes of the trial, of a bizarre incident in early May in which he swam to her home, party spokesman Nyan Win said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	3	631	The Nobel laureate is on trial at Yangon's notorious Insein Prison and faces up to five years in jail on charges of breaching the terms of her house arrest. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	4	788	She has spent 13 of the past 19 years in detention. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	5	849	"Aung San Suu Kyi said she is not completely satisfied as Mr Yettaw and the authorities went into her compound last week for a demonstration (of how he got into the property)," Nyan Win told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	6	1054	"It was not in accordance with the law. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	7	1094	She said it was unjust bullying," added Nyan Win, who is both the spokesman for her National League for Democracy party and also part of her legal team. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	8	1256	Yettaw, a 53-year-old Mormon and former US military veteran, was arrested on May 6 after swimming to Aung San Suu Kyi's house using a pair of homemade flippers and spending two nights there. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	9	1447	He is also on trial. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	10	1477	Critics say Myanmar's military regime has trumped up the charges in a bid to keep her locked up ahead of elections in 2010, as the latest six-year period of her house arrest expired on Wednesday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	11	1682	Nyan Win said that despite the apparently unfortunate timing of the incident, Aung San Suu Kyi did not harbour hard feelings against Yettaw. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	12	1832	"She also said she has no grudge to Mr Yettaw and his family," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	13	1913	Aung San Suu Kyi told the trial last week that she had not violated her house arrest and that she had only offered Yettaw ""temporary shelter" as he was ill. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0378	14	2080	She insisted that she could not be held responsible as the junta had failed to boost security despite her having reported that Yettaw made a previous visit to the house in November 2008.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0379	0	58	Fate of Tamil Tiger spy chief unclear: report 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0379	1	178	The Sri Lankan military is probing the possibility that the Tamil Tiger's spy chief may still be alive, despite testimony that he was killed with the rest of the rebel leadership. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0379	2	367	"The military is still investigating Tiger intelligence wing leader Pottu Amman's death as they could not find his body among the top level Tiger leaders," the state-run Sunday Observer said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0379	3	568	Amman was seen as the number two in the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) hierarchy after rebel leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and was believed to have masterminded the 1991 assassination of Indian premier Rajiv Gandhi. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0379	4	802	The newspaper, which reflects government policy, said the military had testimony from a surrendered Tiger cadre who claimed that the spy leader had been killed before the final battle in which Prabhakaran perished. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0379	5	1026	However, no body was ever found. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0379	6	1068	Amman is the subject of an international arrest warrant for the Gandhi slaying as well as the 1996 bombing of the Sri Lankan Central Bank which killed 91 people. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0379	7	1239	The Observer said the military could not confirm the deaths of Prabhakaran's wife, Mathiwathini, and their daughter, Dwarka, although they were suspected to have been in the same area during the final military offensive against the LTTE. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0379	8	1486	The military on Thursday identified Prabhakaran's parents, who had sought shelter with security forces after fleeing the conflict zone.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	1	184	Indian students rallied in Melbourne on Sunday as Australia scrambled to contain outrage over a wave of attacks that has seen it labelled racist and strained diplomatic relations with New Delhi. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	2	388	What began as a local policing issue in Australia's second largest city has spiralled into a crisis that prompted Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to call his Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh last week to assure him about student safety. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	3	629	The students are demanding action after more than 70 assaults on their peers in a year in Melbourne, including at least four in the past fortnight, and there has been prominent coverage in newspapers here and in India. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	4	857	Pictures from a hospital bed of a comatose Sravan Kumar Theerthala, who was stabbed with a screwdriver by gatecrashers at a party, were splashed across newspapers in India. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	5	1030	A teenager has been charged with attempted murder. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	6	1090	"They were saying, 'Don't touch us you Indians' and 'Indians go home' before they got the screwdriver," said Theerthala's friend, Jayasanka Bagpelli. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	7	1249	Another student, Baljinder Singh, told Australian public radio last week how his attackers laughed as he pleaded with them during a robbery at a Melbourne train station. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	8	1428	"I was saying to them, 'I'm giving you all my money, don't kill me, don't kill me'," said Singh, who was stabbed and left with a six-inch (15-centimetre) wound to his stomach and advised Indians to stay away from Australia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	9	1661	Indian media have dubbed the attacks "curry bashings", picking up on a term reportedly used by some of the youths behind the violence in Melbourne's western suburbs, where police say 30 percent of assault victims are Indian. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	10	1895	It is a grossly disproportionate figure in a city of almost four million people where the Indian student population numbers less than 50,000. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	11	2046	Police deny any racial element to the attacks, arguing Indian students were often simply in the wrong place at the wrong time as they travelled home late at night with items such as mobile phones and portable MP3 players. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	12	2277	But Indian High Commissioner to Australia Sujatha Singh said last week that racism was playing a part, even if some of the crimes were "opportunistic". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	13	2438	Federation of Indian Students president Amit Menghani, who led the rally of more than a thousand supporters through central Melbourne Sunday, said the police attitude had frustrated many students. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	14	2644	Bagpelli, who attended the rally, added: "It's only because the Indian government is now applying pressure that they are doing anything." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	15	2791	While the attacks are unlikely to result in any permanent damage at a diplomatic level, Canberra is concerned parents in India may prevent their children studying in Australia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	16	2977	That would threaten the international education sector here, a 15.5 billion dollar (12.2 billion US) a year industry that has attracted more than 90,000 Indians to the country. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	17	3163	More broadly, with headlines such as "Australia, land of racism" running in overseas media, there are also fears Australia's reputation for tolerance is sustaining long-term damage. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	18	3354	A string of government ministers have made statements recently emphasising the country's multi-cultural society and relatively low levels of violence. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	19	3514	"We need to help make sure that the mothers and fathers of all students who come here are assured that Australia is a safe location to come to, that our general crime rates and violence rates are very low," Foreign Minister Stephen Smith told commercial television Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	20	3796	The assault on Theerthala proved the catalyst, High Commissioner Singh describing it as a particularly distressing case. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	21	3926	It sparked a flurry of high-level diplomatic activity and strong public statements from Indian officials that indicated they had run out of patience. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0381	22	4085	"Such attacks cannot be allowed to happen," Singh said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0383	0	58	Indian author Kamala Das dead at 75 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0383	1	170	Writer and poet Kamala Das, known for her frank discussion of female sexuality in conservative India, died in hospital on Sunday, the Press Trust of India reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0383	2	335	She was 75. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0383	3	356	Das died in the western city of Pune after a long illness, PTI said, without specifying the cause of death. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0383	4	473	Das was born into a family of writers and wrote poems and short stories in English and Malayalam, the language of her southern home state of Kerala. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0383	5	631	She was one of the first Indian writers to explore sexual themes in her work, and her 1976 autobiography, My Story, was a candid recollection of her own sexual coming of age that was translated into 15 languages. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0383	6	853	Das converted to Islam in 1999 and took the name Kamala Surayya, but later appeared to regret it, saying "God has no connection with any religion. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0383	7	1000	There is no respect for women anywhere." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0383	8	1050	She also dabbled in politics, launching the Lok Seva Party but failing to win a seat in parliament. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0383	9	1159	Das is survived by two sons.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0387	1	190	Ailing General Motors moved closer Sunday to its expected bankruptcy filing as company bondholders approved a  government-sponsored debt for equity deal, The New York Times reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0387	2	382	The bondholders had until 5:00 pm (2100 GMT) Saturday to indicate whether they supported the group's new offer ahead of the once mighty corporation's looming bankruptcy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0387	3	561	The government's rescue plan for GM could put as much as 72.5 percent of the country's biggest automaker under state ownership. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0387	4	698	Citing "people briefed on the matter," the newspaper said the bondholders with slightly more than 50 percent of GM’s 27.2 billion dollars in bond debt agreed to support the plan by the government-set deadline. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0387	5	917	Among the backers was a committee of large investors holding about 20 percent of GM’s outstanding bonds, The Times said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0387	6	1047	No official announcement of the vote tally has yet been made. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0387	7	1118	Under the plan, the bondholders would obtain the rights to buy an extra 15 percent of GM's stock at a low price. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0387	8	1231	They would also control 25 percent of the "new GM," after having supported the new company's creation in bankruptcy court. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0387	9	1363	Recalcitrant bondholders who opt for confrontation rather than cooperation "will get nothing or very little," an Obama administration official told reporters Thursday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0387	10	1540	Government-backed restructuring in bankruptcy court for GM, once the world's largest automaker, appeared all but certain ahead of a Monday deadline imposed by the Obama administration on the company to submit a viable restructuring plan or file for bankruptcy.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	1	193	Sri Lanka appealed Sunday for support in dismantling the Tamil Tigers' international support network after declaring victory over the rebels following the decades-long conflict. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	2	380	Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama told a high-level security forum in Singapore that the global organisation of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) remained "largely intact." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	3	575	"Many of the operatives have clearly cultivated powerful, political lobbies in certain capitals with a view to resurrecting the LTTE," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	4	728	"It is important for the international community to take all measures to assist the government of Sri Lanka to track down the global network of the LTTE," he told an annual forum of defence and military officials organised by the London- based International Institute for Strategic Studies. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	5	1028	Sri Lanka's military claimed complete victory over the separatist Tamil Tigers after wiping out the guerrillas' leadership nearly two weeks ago, but has been dogged by accusations that thousands of civilians were killed in the final weeks of the campaign. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	6	1293	The LTTE launched a campaign in 1972 to create a Tamil homeland in the Sinhalese-majority island. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	7	1391	Much of its funding came from Tamils overseas. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	8	1447	Bogollagama dismissed allegations that heavy weapons were used by the military in civilian areas as part of the "propaganda of genocide against the Tamil people." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	9	1619	"This was both fictional and well-fabricated, with ulterior and sinister motives in order to discredit the armed forces as well as to embarrass the government of Sri Lanka," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	10	1812	"Sri Lanka will no doubt enter the annals of history as a classic textbook example of a nation that successfully prevailed over the scourge of terrorism, whilst tenaciously upholding the cherished values of democracy and human rights that have been deeply engraved in the psyche of our people," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	11	2125	"The government is firmly committed to reaching a political settlement acceptable to all," the foreign minister said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	12	2252	Sri Lanka's handling of the LTTE "has sent a strong signal to the international community that terror can be defeated and terrorism can be eliminated," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	13	2423	Amnesty International called Saturday for an independent probe into the number of civilians killed following a report in London's Times newspaper citing confidential UN reports that said more than 20,000 civilians were killed by Sri Lankan army shelling. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0388	14	2687	Sri Lanka's Human Rights Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe has dismissed Amnesty's call and said the organisation was being "ridiculous to keep harping on things they cannot substantiate."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0389	1	188	Haitian-born American Andre Berto retained his World Boxing Council welterweight title Saturday with a lopsided unanimous 12-round decision over Colombian Juan Urango. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0389	2	365	Two judges scored the bout 118-110 for the Florida-based Berto, while a third saw it 117-111. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0389	3	468	Berto remained unbeaten in 25 professional fights, with 19 wins inside the distance. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0389	4	562	Urango was frustrated by the nimble Berto, who kept his distance and scored to the head with the jab and with his right. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0389	5	692	Urango' best round was the fourth, when he landed a series of lefts to the head and body. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0389	6	791	But Berto largely avoided Urango's pressure, givig him little opportunity to get inside in the middle rounds while connecting himself with shots to Urango's head with both hands. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0389	7	979	After a lackluster ninth round drew jeers from the crowd, Berto stepped it up in the last three rounds. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0389	8	1092	Urango, who fell to 21-2-1 with 16 wins inside the distance, will now return to the super lightweight ranks, where he is still the International Boxing Federation title holder.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	1	170	Taliban rebels in Pakistan are taking their war to the cities, honing terror tactics to maximise civilian carnage after suffering heavy losses in a blistering military offensive, analysts say. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	2	372	Pakistan has been rocked by 14 bomb blasts that have killed more than 80 people in urban areas since it launched a determined air and ground assault against the Taliban in pockets of the northwest at the end of April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	3	599	The military said on Saturday that troops had regained control of the main town of Mingora in Swat valley from the Taliban, in what is being touted as a significant milestone in the month-long ongoing offensive. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	4	820	But the rebels, who Washington fears threaten Pakistan's very existence, are striking back in cities like the regional capital Peshawar, about 200 kilometres (125 miles) from Mingora and previously shielded from major attacks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	5	1056	"They are taking this war to the cities, hoping to build up enough pressure on the government to halt the military activity," security analyst Hasan Askari told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	6	1231	"The Taliban challenge now threatens routine life and commercial activity in cities... allied extremist groups are facilitating their agenda," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	7	1393	Attackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated, analysts say, executing commando-style assaults armed with suicide vests, vehicle bombs, guns, grenades and rockets. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	8	1570	Over the last two weeks in Peshawar, bombs have exploded outside a cinema, near crowded electronics shops, at a police checkpoint and even alongside a bus full of children with special needs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	9	1771	And in Lahore, Pakistan's entertainment capital, a bomb, gun and grenade assault killed 24 people and partially damaged the provincial headquarters of the country's premier spy agency on Wednesday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	10	1978	It was the third spectacular assault in and around the eastern city -- hundreds of miles from the offensive in the northwest -- in as many months. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	11	2134	The Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP) militant group claimed responsibility, telling people in a statement they should get out of the cities because there will be more violence to come. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	12	2319	Newspaper columnist Shafqat Mehmood said the Taliban, who want to enforce sharia law, are becoming more and more desperate in the face of the military onslaught in the northwest, which the army says has claimed 1,200 rebels. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	13	2553	"Militants are under pressure and will employ any tactic to cause maximum damage. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	14	2635	Urban terrorism is one of those tactics," said Mehmood. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	15	2700	While the government could do more to protect key targets, he said, underfunded and overstretched security forces can only do so much. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	16	2844	"It is difficult to patrol markets and streets," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	17	2912	"Our province is facing a war-like situation," the police chief of North West Frontier Province, Malik Naved Khan, told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	18	3046	"We have 9,000 police. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	19	3069	In a big city like Peshawar, this is not enough to deal with situations like the one we're facing," said Khan. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	20	3189	Northwest expert Rahimullah Yusufzai said the Taliban were increasingly focused on civilian targets as widespread public opinion turns -- for the first time -- in favour of Pakistan's military operation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	21	3402	The offensive already has the firm backing of Washington, which says Al-Qaeda and Taliban have carved out safe havens in the northwestern areas bordering Afghanistan to plot terror attacks on the West. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	22	3613	"The Taliban have jacked up attacks targeting civilians as they have failed to target security forces," Yusufzai said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	23	3741	Echoing Hasan Askari, he added the Taliban will likely have willing allies from a catalogue of banned radical groups that traditionally have battled India in Kashmir. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0391	24	3917	These include Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, Yusufzai said, an extremist element linked to Al-Qaeda, and Lashkar-e-Taiba, accused of carrying out the Mumbai attacks last year that left 166 dead.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0394	1	170	Taliban rebels in Pakistan are taking their war to the cities, honing terror tactics to maximise civilian carnage after suffering heavy losses in a blistering military offensive, analysts say. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0394	2	372	Pakistan has been rocked by 14 bomb blasts that have killed more than 80 people in urban areas since it launched a determined air and ground assault against the Taliban in pockets of the northwest at the end of April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0394	3	599	The military said on Saturday that troops had regained control of the main town of Mingora in Swat valley from the Taliban, in what is being touted as a significant milestone in the month-long ongoing offensive. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0394	4	820	But the rebels, who Washington fears threaten Pakistan's very existence, are striking back in cities like the regional capital Peshawar, about 200 kilometres (125 miles) from Mingora and previously shielded from major attacks.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0401	3	328	The 25-year-old American is the founder of Wordpress, software that allows computer users worldwide to easily create their own websites, or blogs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0401	4	484	The simplicity of Wordpress has made it one of the world's top blogging platforms six years after it was set up, its adherents ranging from knitting fanatics (jessinohio.wordpress.com) to CNN's resident doctor Sanjay Gupta (pagingdrgupta.blogs.cnn.com/site). 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0401	5	752	But in 2006, as the site was growing from strength to strength, Chinese authorities suddenly blocked it.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0401	25	3880	The company, which still has fewer than 100 employees, remains privately held and so does not have to reveal earnings, and though reports have said Mullenweg turned down an offer of 200 million dollars in 2007 for a stake in the firm, money one of the few subjects he is reluctant to discuss.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	1	191	Seven years after being catapulted to fame and fortune with her hit comedy "My Big Fat Greek Wedding", Nia Vardalos makes a long-awaited return to the big screen this month with another film that takes the Canadian-born actress back to her ancestral roots. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	2	457	Vardalos, 46, became an overnight success in 2002, when the romantic comedy she wrote and starred in went on to become a monster hit, earning more than 350 million dollars worldwide after being made for only five million dollars. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	3	696	The success of the film -- which also earned Vardalos a best original screenplay nomination at the Oscars -- allowed Vardalos to take her time deciding her next career move. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	4	879	Although she starred in a short-lived television spin-off of "Greek Wedding", Vardalos has been largely inactive since 2002 preferring to focus on starting a family before relaunching her career with "My Life in Ruins." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	5	1108	Her new film, which goes on release in North America on June 5, sees her play a Greek-American history professor who returns to Greece to work as a tour guide in Athens. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	6	1287	Vardalos said the script for the film, which includes several scenes shot at the Acropolis and other historic sites, had fired her enthusiasm after years out of the spotlight as she attempted to start a family. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	7	1507	"When we got the permission to shoot this film, it was so exciting and it was the first that I had found something where I wanted to be on camera in for a long time," she told reporters in Beverly Hills. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	8	1720	"In 2004, I had come to the end of a 10-year infertility battle and I just chose to privately deal with it, so I stepped back out of acting," said Vardalos, who recently adopted a three-year-old girl with her husband. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	9	1947	"I was really happy to be offered a nice clean script that celebrates Greece and is a love letter to Greece," she adds. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	10	2076	Vardalos says that despite the commercial success of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding", her business relationships with her producers, who include actor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson, have not changed. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	11	2285	"The good news is that you strive for what happened with my first movie for your whole life," Vardalos said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	12	2394	"And so it happened and its like, 'oh that's over, the rest is gravy.' 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	13	2474	"The greater news is that my producers are the same producers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	14	2537	They treated me like gold before 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' made a dime. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	15	2610	And they don't expect anything from me, except let's have fun and let's tell fun stories." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	16	2710	Vardalos, who did not write "My Life In Ruins," continues to pen screenplays. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	17	2797	But she says she has resisted the temptation to try and regurgitate the formula from "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" in an attempt to score another commercial bullseye. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	18	2970	"I write little movies and then the rest is up to the audience," she said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	19	3045	"It's the audience that made 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' a success. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	20	3121	"I think if you create with a financial goal in mind, artistically you are dead. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	21	3202	Its best to tell fun stories and let the audience decide." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	22	3270	However Vardalos makes no apologies for the fact that "My Life In Ruins" and another upcoming film "I Hate Valentine's Day," which she wrote, directed and stars in, are both romantic comedies, like "Greek Wedding." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	23	3494	"I think that reviewers and the industry think that romance is dead," Vardalos said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	24	3579	"I think the audience wants it and needs it. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	25	3624	I know I do. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	26	3646	"As I keep saying, as the average person, I like to escape into a movie. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0402	27	3719	I like movies like 'Terminator' and 'Star Trek' as well."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	1	208	The ancient mystery shrouding Lalibela, Ethiopia's revered medieval rock-hewn churches, could be lifted by a group of French researchers given the go-ahead for the first comprehensive study of this world heritage site legend says was "built by angels". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	2	470	The team will have full access to the network of 10 Orthodox chapels chiseled out of volcanic rock -- some standing 15 metres (42 feet) high -- in the mountainous heart of Ethiopia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	3	661	Local lore holds they were built in less than 25 years by their namesake, the 13th-century King Lalibela, with the help of angels after God ordered him to erect a "New Jerusalem". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	4	850	The monolithic structures are located 500 kilometres (300 miles) north of the capital Addis Ababa. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	5	949	Long a holy pilgrimage site in a land proud of its Christian Orthodox heritage, they are also a travel draw in a poverty-stricken country hoping to boost tourism. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	6	1121	The multidisciplinary team of historians, archaeologists, topographers and a specialist in liturgy will spend several weeks probing the subterranean complex to try to identify its origins. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	7	1319	Historian Marie Laure Derat, with the French Centre for Ethiopian Studies (CFEE), said "there are several theories". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	8	1436	In one, "an Egyptian patriarch was believed to be the source of these structures, another says the 13th-century King Lalibela built the site from scratch." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	9	1601	"During the day the king would work with Ethiopian artisans and at night he would 'be helped by angels'. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	10	1706	Some even cite a key role by the Knights Templar," she said, referring to one of the key Western Christian military orders of the Middle Ages. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	11	1858	Though earlier studies have been carried out, they were generally by lone researchers with restricted access who studied mainly church interiors . 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	12	2014	Derat said the heretofore reluctant Orthodox church gave the French team carte blanche to probe "the entire site, not just the churches, to understand how the periods overlap and to read history in this open book that is Lalibela". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	13	2255	Funded by the French government and Ethiopian Airlines, the team is already certain the chapels were not built in one go. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	14	2386	Research chief Francois Xavier Fauvelle said three distinct periods have been identified in the maze of deep tunnels, passageways and chapels, some of which resemble ancient Greek temples. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	15	2584	"There was originally a basalt dome under which we found evidence of cave dwellers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	16	2668	Then there was the construction of a fortress with trenches, a perimetre wall and underground tunnels," he said pointing to rocks he said where once part of the defence wall. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	17	2852	"The third period was established thanks to an enormous mound of earth about 20 metres high that came from the excavation of the church of Gabriel Ruphael," he said, referring to the chapel some believe was once King Lalibela's residence. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	18	3100	"The Ruphael Gabriel church was probably part of the fortress and was turned into a church: the facade was extended, windows opened and a chapel dug out," said Fauvelle. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	19	3279	UNESCO added Lalibela to its world heritage list in 1978, a boon for tourism efforts in this country of 85 million where poverty is rampant and agriculture accounts for nearly half the economy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	20	3473	Visitors can already join organized tours of the site. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	21	3537	But the bid to shed light on its origins has not shaken the Orthodox clergy and faithful here, who contend that Lalibela arose with divine intervention. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	22	3699	"It is God through his angels who made these churches," said Alebachew Reta, spokesman for the Lalibela clergy who insisted "the 10 churches were created in just 24 years." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	23	3881	"You can observe that even one would be difficult to build in that space of time. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	24	3963	So for us it is God's work," said Reta. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0403	25	4003	"For the one who created mankind, building these churches was not difficult."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	1	208	The world outcry over Israeli settlements in the West Bank is absurd since God gave this land to the Jews, says Rabbi Yaakov Savir. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	2	340	The Arabs, he says, should make their home elsewhere. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	3	403	"This territory is Jewish territory," says Savir, a settler who runs a religious school in the Havat Gilad outpost which consists of little more than a few tin huts and weather-worn trailers, some horses and chickens and several car wrecks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	4	653	"This is our home," he says, making a sweeping gesture towards the Jewish settlements that dominate nearby hilltops to show he means the entire West Bank, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Six-Day-War. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	5	876	Havat Gilad, which 20 families call home, is a wildcat outpost, meaning that unlike full-scale settlements, it is not authorised by the Israeli government. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	6	1041	The international community considers all settlements illegal, and the issue is one of the thorniest in peace efforts with the Palestinians. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	7	1191	With US pressure mounting, Israel could soon make good on its years-old pledge to tear down a couple of dozen outposts. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	8	1320	In Havat Gilad's case, it wouldn't be the first time. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	9	1383	Built by Moshe Zar, a former member of a Jewish underground movement that planted bombs in the cars of Arab mayors, the outpost was torn down by the Israeli authorities barely hours after a group of teenagers pitched the first tents in 2002. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	10	1625	Rebuilding started the next day. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	11	1667	Savir is outraged the government of right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would even consider bulldozing Jewish homes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	12	1802	"Jewish people live here by Biblical right," he claims, standing in the trailer that houses the religious school, surrounded by students who sport the look favoured by ideologically motivated religious settlers -- long locks, knitted skullcap, loose clothing and sandals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	13	2083	Savir insists he has nothing against Arabs -- he won't speak of Palestinians other than to say there is no such people. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	14	2212	"If Arabs want to stay, we won't kill them, we won't expel them. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	15	2286	"They are the ones who want to kill us, who don't want us to live in our home," he says. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	16	2384	"Arabs," he adds "should find another place to live." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	17	2447	The vast majority of the 280,000 Jews who live in the 120 West Bank settlements which Israel considers legal, have moved to the area for economic reasons. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	18	2602	But the hardliners who share Savir's views that Jewish people have a God-given right to the land are extremely vocal and at times violent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	19	2750	Rabbi Savir is convinced the residents of Havat Gilad, like others in similar outposts, "will certainly fight for every millimeter. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	20	2882	No one will leave his home." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	21	2920	Israel agreed in 2003 to freeze all settlement activity and raze wildcat outposts but has not followed through on those commitments. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	22	3062	Outposts, typically located a few hundred metres (yards) from government- authorised settlements, include anything from a few shacks to communities of several dozen semi-permanent homes connected to the electricity and water grids. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	23	3303	Many of the 100 or so outposts were built on West Bank hills by militant teenagers, known as "hilltop youths," with the aim of planting the seeds of new full-fledged settlements. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	24	3491	A 2005 government-commissioned report said that in some cases officials authorised seizure of private Palestinian land to create outposts, and facilitated their connection to the water and power mains. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	25	3702	Palestinians see the outposts as part of a land grab and a scheme to further consolidate Israel's control over the West Bank, which is home to 2.4 million Palestinians. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	26	3880	Faced with mounting pressure from within his right-wing coalition on the one hand and the United States on the other, Netanyahu has vowed to continue building in existing settlement blocs while indicating he will dismantle wildcat outposts. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	27	4130	But he has failed to placate either side. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	28	4181	The premier has faced fierce criticism from the right for his willingness to tear down Jewish homes, and some blunt talk from Washington over settlement expansion. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	29	4354	US President Barack Obama told Netanyahu during May 18 White House talks he wants a complete freeze of settlement activity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	30	4487	"Not some settlements, not outposts, not natural growth exceptions," Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, explaining the demand. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	31	4629	Israeli police did tear down Maoz Esther, north of the West Bank political capital of Ramallah, on May 21, but the move was dismissed by Israeli media as a meaningless token gesture. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	32	4812	The outpost consisted of just seven tin and plywood shacks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	33	4881	One week after the demolition, one house had already been rebuilt and another was being constructed without any hindrance from the authorities. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	34	5034	"We must settle here, God has ordered us to live on this land," says Daniel Landesberg, 20, as he and a group of teenagers spread out cement being poured out of a large concrete mixer truck to form the base of a new house. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	35	5266	Landesberg is a firm believer in the "doubling" tactic adopted by hardline settlers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	36	5360	"They tore down seven homes, we will build 14," he says, smiling. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	37	5435	And if the 14 are razed? 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0404	38	5460	"We'll build twice that many."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	1	164	GM's overall future may look grim, but half a world away from Detroit in Shanghai, business has never been better. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	2	288	The US auto giant is beating sales records in China and may soon be exporting Chinese-made cars to the United States.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	8	1189	GM has proposed shipping 17,335 Chinese-made cars to the US in 2011 and increasing that to 51,546 by 2014 -- representing 1.6 percent of its forecast 3.1 million cars five years from now, the Automotive News reported. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	9	1416	China led the world in auto sales in April, and GM China's joint ventures led the pack, with sales rising 29.9 percent on year to 151,084 vehicles, driven by demand for Buicks and small Wuling "bread vans" that cost less than 5,000 dollars. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	10	1666	"It's definitely one of the market leaders here -- in drastic contrast to their performance in the US," said Shen Jun, an auto analyst at Roland Berger.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	17	2691	"They think they are doing much better than the parent company in the US," he said, saying GM's success in China boils down to smart decisions, good timing and luck that has put it far ahead of US rivals Ford and Chrysler. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0406	18	2923	GM teamed with China's largest automaker Shanghai Automotive Industry Group or SAIC, in 1997 -- foreign carmakers here need a local joint venture partner -- after SAIC rejected Toyota and before Ford could sign a deal, Shen said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0407	18	1939	But even through the downsizing and plant closures of the 1980s and 1990s, the workers who remained at General Motors were able to hang onto their high wages and benefits. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0407	19	2120	That ended in the latest round of restructuring, which began in 2005 and ended with the union agreeing to slash benefits, cut wages in half for new workers, and even give up the right to strike until 2015.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0410	27	3940	When fuel prices began to rise and consumers shifted away from gasoline guzzles, GM's sales -- and profits -- crashed. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0410	28	4068	The latest round of plant closures and layoffs began in November 2005. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0410	29	4148	Since then, GM's US workforce has been slashed by nearly half from 160,000 at the end of 2004 to 83,315 at the end of April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0410	30	4282	The real problem, analysts say, is that GM waited too long to address the ballooning "legacy costs" associated with supporting generations of retirees with a US market share that had slipped to 26 percent by 2005. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0410	31	4505	GM's costs for each vehicle built were about 2,000 to 2,500 dollars higher than the US plants of its Asian rivals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0410	32	4629	GM was able to reach a historic deal with the United Auto Workers union to slash labor costs in 2007, but only after spending 103 billion dollars to fund pensions and retiree health care from 1993 through 2007. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0410	33	4849	And though GM has managed to dramatically improve its product quality and offerings in recent years, it was too little too late. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	0	58	Can GM succeed as 'Government Motors'? 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	1	174	General Motors, readying a massive bankruptcy filing backed by billions in public funds, faces a complex set of challenges as a virtually nationalized "Government Motors," analysts say. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	2	369	With the US government expected to hold as much as 72.5 percent of the new firm that would emerge from bankruptcy, analysts say a big question is whether GM can concentrate on the difficult auto marketplace. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	3	586	"The tricky part is to leave day-to-day management to the executives of the company," said Jeremy Anwyl, chief executive at auto research firm Edmunds.com. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	4	751	For the government, he said, "the temptation is to influence product decisions based on political considerations instead of market considerations, and that's always a danger." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	5	936	Anwyl said it is too soon to tell how the matter will be handled by the administration of President Barack Obama, which has pledged to get out of the business as soon as GM gets back on its feet. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	6	1141	David Cole, chairman of the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research, said the government officials "are smart, dedicated people, but they can't learn the key issues of this industry in a short time." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	7	1356	Cole said the government can succeed if it focuses on the goal of restoring profitability, getting taxpayer money repaid and then getting out of GM. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	8	1514	"If the government forces a company to go out of step with the reality of the marketplace, that's a problem," Cole said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	9	1644	"If you force the industry to build products they can't sell profitably, that's a problem." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	10	1745	Cole said it was "almost unavoidable that the government will try to superimpose other agendas" on the carmaker. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	11	1867	Cole and Anwyl said it would be a mistake for the government to use its role as the financial backer of GM or Chrysler to push the firms into building certain types of cars to meet environmental or other goals because consumer demands can change quickly. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	12	2131	Anwyl said that with the current level of fuel prices, demand for small, fuel- efficient cars is decreasing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	13	2240	He added the Obama administration's effort to further boost fuel efficiency may hurt efforts to help Detroit automakers become profitable again. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	14	2394	Peter Cohan, a management consultant and faculty member at Babson College, said GM must keep a focus on "developing a line of products that can compete with Toyota, Nissan and the rest of the world." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	15	2603	"I hope the government doesn't push GM to make hybrids just for the sake of doing it but because it will be profitable strategy ... 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	16	2735	They need to design and build a vehicle that will last longer than a Toyota with lower maintenance costs." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	17	2851	Although some GM critics blame existing management for its woes, Anwyl said the carmaker's biggest problems stemmed from decisions made years or even decades earlier. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	18	3027	"These festered over the years and GM never really confronted them," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	19	3114	The US government is expected to invest an additional 30 billion dollars to help GM on top of its 20 billion dollars in loans, with most of the funds being converted to the equity stake of as much as 72.5 percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	20	3337	The US stake could be reduced by a share given to the governments of Canada and Ontario province, expected to pitch in with around nine billion dollars. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	21	3499	John Pottow, a law professor and bankruptcy specialist at the University of Michigan, said the proposed ownership structure raises a lot of hackles. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	22	3657	"Everyone is terrified of government mandates as opposed to market forces," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	23	3742	"But I take it as face value the government saying they want to be reluctant shareholders." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	24	3843	GM vice chairman Robert Lutz said the administration is taking appropriate measures to help an industry vital to the US economy, and praised Obama's Automotive Task Force. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	25	4024	"Their prime goal is not to gain government control of the automobile industry," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	26	4123	"They absolutely don't want that ... their number one goal is to make us successful. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0411	27	4208	There finally is a realization that our country cannot remain economically strong and militarily strong and have a global impact if it’s not backed up by wealth-producing industries." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	0	58	GM to lose prestigious spot on Dow 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	1	168	General Motors' fall from grace is not yet complete. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	2	221	The firm's expected bankruptcy would spell its eviction from the Dow Jones coveted list of 30 top US companies, of which GM has been a pillar since 1925. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	3	384	Even if GM's court filing has not yet been inked, speculation is rife about which firm might take its place on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as the former behemoth's share price tumbled 47 percent last week. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	4	605	GM's shares fell to 75 cents each on Friday, well below the one dollar minimum for listing on the New York-based exchange. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	5	737	It is a confluence of factors that means GM will suffer the same fate as AIG. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	6	815	In September, the insurance giant was removed from the Dow Jones index two days after its nationalization, replaced by Kraft Foods. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	7	956	"Once a company files for bankruptcy protection it is disqualified from being one of the 30 Dow components," said Dow spokesperson Sybille Reitz. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	8	1111	"We are aware of GM's situation and are taking steps accordingly. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	9	1177	We have been following the situation closely." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	10	1233	There is great competition to replace GM on the venerable list, which has served as a bellwether for US business since it was launched in 1896. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	11	1386	One solution could be to replace GM with its rival Ford -- which has so far managed to escape the crisis without government aid. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	12	1524	But Ford's share price is far from stellar, trading at around 5.75 dollars. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	13	1600	According to John Ogg of 247wallst.com, that makes the firm -- which had previously been a member of the elite club -- an unlikely inductee. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	14	1750	One of the more frequently cited names is that of Wall Street darling Goldman Sachs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	15	1844	The investment giant should be one of the first to pay back government loans, thanks to a share price of more than 144 dollars. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	16	1981	Nicholas Colas, head of investment strategy at the BNY ConvergEx Group, said that makes Goldman Sachs a favorite. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	17	2104	It may also have been helped by AIG's departure. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	18	2162	During the AIG shakeout in September the Dow Jones group noted that the exit of one financial firm meant that that economically vital sector was under- represented. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	19	2336	But there are other contenders. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	20	2368	From the technology sector Apple, Google, Cisco and Oracle are mentioned as possible replacements. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	21	2476	Google's candidature runs into the difficulty that its share price -- at over 400 dollars a piece -- may skew the index. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	22	2606	And technology stocks are already well represented by heavyweight IBM. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	23	2686	A recent poll by CNBC has further muddied the picture. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	24	2741	The financial news provider asked customers who should replace GM. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	25	2808	The response was Abbott Labs, a pharmaceuticals firm. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	26	2871	From the biotech field, Monsanto is an outsider. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	27	2920	Owen Patrick of Deutsche Bank pointed out that Monsanto was an important member of another index, the Standard and Poor's 500. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	28	3056	"It is a little smaller in market cap," said BNY's Colas, "and not as well known, but its technology and competitive advantage would be unique in the Dow." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	29	3221	If the GM change has been keenly anticipated, that is because change on the Dow is rare. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	30	3319	Only six firms have come in this decade, with three in 2008 including Kraft -- Bank of America and Chevron replaced Altria and Honeywell. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	31	3466	According to Ogg the index's managers may use the opportunity to dump other listings hit by the financial crisis. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0412	32	3589	Citigroup, now trading at four dollars a share, must feel its head is on the chopping block. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0413	0	58	Malaysia's Islamic party at a crossroads 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0413	1	178	A power struggle in Malaysia's Islamic party will be put to the test in leadership polls this week which pit hardline clerics against young moderates who want to rebrand the party. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0413	2	368	The Pan-Malaysia Islamic Party (PAS) has enjoyed a surge in popularity thanks to deep public disillusionment with the Barisan Nasional coalition that has governed the multiracial country for half a century. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0413	3	584	PAS has formed an unlikely alliance with two other opposition parties which has stuck together despite wide differences in their ideologies, giving them a chance to unseat the coalition in the next elections due in several years. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0413	4	823	But the PAS general assembly on June 5-7 will lay bare the dilemma at the party's core -- whether to swing back to its hardline roots or to put on a more moderate face to continue winning back support after some barren years. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0413	5	1058	"The party is at a threshold -- whether it can transcend its history of catering largely to Muslims and put in place a model that everyone in the country including non-Muslims can accept," said pollster Ibrahim Suffian. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0413	6	1287	"They need to be able to articulate issues relating to the economy, security, international trade... to not only look after your hereafter, but look after your here and today," said Ibrahim, from Merdeka Centre research. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0413	7	1517	Some 60 percent of Malaysians are Muslim Malays, but the population includes large ethnic Chinese and Indian communities, and if PAS wants to break out beyond its niche it needs to attract support from minorities. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0413	8	1740	Curiously, despite pushing for the creation of an Islamic state and the introduction of "hudud" laws like chopping off thieves' hands, PAS has won the trust and support of many non-Muslims. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0413	9	1939	Chinese and Indian voters have enthusiastically supported PAS candidates in seats where they stood for the Pakatan Rakyat opposition alliance, and thousands have joined PAS "Supporters' Clubs" around the country. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0413	10	2161	Much of the attraction stems from PAS's reputation as a clean party untainted by the corruption which is endemic in the ruling coalition. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0413	11	2308	And in northern Kelantan state, where it has long been in power, minorities have few complaints and are not obliged to observe local bylaws that discourage skimpy clothing and high heels. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0413	12	2505	Reforms introduced before landmark 2008 elections, when the Pakatan Rakyat snatched a third of parliamentary seats in an unprecedented performance, reversed a decline that had seen PAS decimated in 2004 polls. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0413	13	2724	"They stopped talking about wanting to impose stricter sharia laws and they had much more moderate faces in the party, people who were professionals and able to converse in English," said Ibrahim. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0413	14	2930	But this rebranding exercise is now in jeopardy with a vote for top leadership posts, including the deputy presidency, which will see a clash between incumbent Nasharuddin Mat Isa and challenger Husam Musa. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0413	15	3146	Husam is an economist who typifies the party's new generation of educated professionals, while Nasharuddin is closely identified with the party's conservative president Abdul Hadi Awang. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0413	16	3342	Husam is an ally of PAS's iconic spiritual leader Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat, a quirky figure who is a highly respected religious leader and also a big supporter of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0413	17	3545	Nasharuddin meanwhile played a leading role in "secret" talks last year with the ruling party UMNO -- which leads the Barisan Nasional coalition -- that were hugely controversial within the party. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0413	18	3751	Observers say that if Nasharuddin retains his post, the fragile bonds between the opposition partners will begin to erode, jeopardising its ability to challenge the coalition.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0413	20	3965	This meeting will see whether PAS is inclined to have a good relationship with UMNO or have a good relationship with its opposition partners," a party insider told AFP.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0419	1	180	Described by inmates as a "hell" where beatings are common and disease is rife, Myanmar's Insein Prison, where Aung San Suu Kyi is on trial, is the brutal symbol of the ruling junta's repression. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0419	2	385	The Nobel laureate has spent the past three weeks incarcerated in a so-called "guest house" at the jail on the outskirts of Yangon while her trial takes place behind closed doors at the notorious compound.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	1	190	India's economy is on the upswing with eyes now keenly focused on July's planned budget for new market-opening moves by the freshly re-elected Congress government, analysts say. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	2	377	The country logged unexpectedly strong 5.8 percent growth in the final quarter to March 2009, against forecasts of 5.0 percent, figures late last week showed, prompting analysts to say the economy had turned the corner. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	3	606	"We see a new growth cycle taking shape with the first stop seven percent and then eight percent," said Rajeev Malik, economist at Macquarie Securities. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	4	768	India's economy expanded by 6.7 percent in the year to March 2009, down from nine percent a year earlier. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	5	883	But the country of nearly 1.2 billion people is performing far better than many others caught in the global slump, thanks to its vast, resilient domestic market, hefty government spending and aggressive rate cuts, analysts say. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	6	1120	Foreign capital is pouring back into India with the benchmark Sensex share index near a nine-month high of 14,625 following a spurt in May after the Congress party was swept back to power with its biggest seat haul in 18 years. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	7	1357	The strong mandate allows the Congress to govern without the support of the communists who propped up the government in parliament during its last term. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	8	1519	Economists called the Congress win a "game changer" for the economy because it raises hopes of political stability for the next five years and the introduction of economic reforms that had been blocked by the Left. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	9	1743	There has already been a flurry of announcements by new ministers promising such moves as loosening state-controlled fuel pump prices, which would help refinery profits, and cutting mobile call rates to propel India's explosively growing cellular sector. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	10	2007	Economic growth is forecast at around six percent in the first half of the year and closer to seven percent in the second amid "green shoots" signs such as higher car sales and cement output. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	11	2208	Next year, economists expect expansion of eight percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	12	2274	"We expect a pick-up in economic activity from lower borrowing costs and higher government spending which is feeding through the system," said Shubhada  Rao, economist at Yes Bank. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	13	2464	In another positive sign, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) announced Saturday a sharp upturn in business optimism. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	14	2622	Some 57 percent of 300 firms polled in the final quarter to March declared economic conditions were "moderately to substantially" better -- up from the nine percent in the previous quarter who reported an improvement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	15	2849	"Companies are looking forward to a recovery on the basis of their order books and performance," FICCI economist Anjan Roy said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	16	2987	Economists are now focused on the budget that Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee has promised to present in the first week of July to see what steps he will take to open up India's still relatively inward-looking economy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	17	3217	Mukherjee said last week the government would press ahead with some long stymied reforms "in the financial sector and real economy" to make it more competitive and draw foreign investment. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	18	3415	The government may privatise some state-owned firms and raise  foreign-ownership caps in insurance and aviation as well as possibly broadening overseas investment access in retailing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	19	3608	But Mukherjee said his "top priority" was "reviving the growth momentum" and helping the poor and he would step up spending even if this meant scant progress in closing India's yawning fiscal deficit, which at 6.2 percent is at a seven- year peak. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	20	3865	HSBC economist Robert Prior Wandesforde forecast no "big bang" reforms in a country where economic changes can provoke huge debate. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0425	21	4006	But "even if they (the government) do a few things, the multiplier effect will be quite significant," said Macquarie's Malik.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0428	1	179	Malaysian police are probing three opposition members for alleged sedition and slander against the prime minister, amid allegations of a mounting crackdown on dissent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0428	2	356	In recent weeks, police have raided the offices of one of the parties in the Pakatan Rakyat opposition alliance, and arrested more than 160 people for protesting against the government's takeover of northern Perak state. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0428	3	586	In the latest move, police questioned the opposition trio, including two lawmakers, over speeches made in the campaign for a by-election in the island state of Penang on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0428	4	773	"This is definitely another step towards creating a police state. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0428	5	839	It is clearly an abuse of power," said Lim Kit Siang from the Democratic Action Party, who was one of the lawmakers questioned by police. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0428	6	986	"The Perak crisis is broadening into a national crisis of confidence where one government institution after another is suffering from a credibility crisis as they have been made to serve the premier's agenda," he said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	0	58	Bordeaux bets on top quality but cheap 2008 vintage 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	1	193	After months of gloom, Bordeaux wine traders are hoping the 2008 vintage will revive the market after steep price cuts and rave reviews from the world's most influential connoisseur. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	2	385	The southwestern French region's rarest wines are sold every spring as a futures commodity, 12 months prior to bottling. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	3	506	With the world gripped by recession, many had been fearing financial disaster. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	4	594	The futures sale only concerns a tiny percentage of the 800 million bottles the Bordeaux region produces annually, but the prices of the top 20 wines help determine the public perception of the quality of the vintage. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	5	821	This year, the big wine estates brought prices down sharply, opening the way for traders to target middle market wine drinkers after a period when the finest wines were priced for sale to only the richest speculators. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	6	1048	As Patrick Bernard, owner of wine merchant powerhouse Millesima, explained: "If the top 20 wines double or triple their prices as they did in 2005, all of Bordeaux wine is perceived as expensive. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	7	1253	"The first wine on the market was Angelus, one of those 20 wines, and they cut their price by 40 percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	8	1359	A few days later, the First Growths came out with a 45 percent decrease and then Yquem with a 65 percent decrease." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	9	1484	Other premium wines were released at the same time to maintain momentum. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	10	1557	Leoville Barton dropped its ex-cellar price to 23 euros and sold out within a few hours. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	11	1655	"It was much better than I expected," said Lilian Barton, co-owner of the legendary estates Chateaux Leoville Barton and Langoa Barton, and director of her family wine merchant, Les Vins Fins Anthony Barton. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	12	1872	In addition to dropping their prices, the chateaux had hoped to demonstrate their independence from US wine critic Robert Parker, nicknamed the "Million Dollar Nose" for his influence on the market. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	13	2080	Parker is a champion of Bordeaux's wines, but many in the industry feel that he wields too much power with his rankings, and three-quarters of the wines were put on sale before he had given his verdict. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	14	2292	The demonstration of defiance was only partly successful, at best. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	15	2368	Several sources said that sales prior to the release of Parker's ratings, with the exception of a few star buys, were subdued. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	16	2495	The tempo changed when Parker awarded the vintage spectacular ratings. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	17	2575	"The buyers went berserk," said Barton. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	18	2624	Clients who had pleaded poverty in early April suddenly found the wherewithal to buy on futures. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	19	2730	Despite annoyance with the fickle importers, Barton, Anson, Bernard and others were relieved to see the return of traditional customers who had been pushed out of the market in recent years by skyrocketing prices. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	20	2953	The vintage was very good and there was a dramatic drop in price -- buyers are stocking up for customers who buy wine to drink rather than to invest. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	21	3112	"This was the vintage to buy for the consumer," enthused Bernard. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	22	3187	Unlike nearly all of the other 400 wine merchants, Millesima, with annual revenues of 52 million euros, sells directly to the consumer in 11 European countries and America. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	23	3369	"Direct sales to European consumers has been good. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	24	3420	There's no currency problem and they haven't been able to afford it over the last few years." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	25	3523	Bernard will buy 35,000 cases this year, a 10 percent increase over last year even though most chateaux are offering customers only 80 percent of their usual allocations because of a small crop. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	26	3727	While the 2008 futures campaign is slowly drawing to a close, there is little doubt that for many it succeeded in resuscitating not only sales but the image of Bordeaux wine as a consumer product. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0429	27	3933	Already merchants and winegrowers are looking forward to Vinexpo, the International Wine and Spirits Exhibition held from June 21 to 25, with 45,000 professionals expected to attend. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	0	58	Eurozone interest rate locked, new steps on tap: analysts 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	1	192	The main eurozone interest rate is probably locked in at 1.0 percent for now, but credit flows remain weak and the European Central Bank will detail this week new ways to get money flowing again. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	2	397	The ECB will also release Thursday its latest staff forecasts for growth and inflation in the 16-nation bloc, with a downward revision likely for the former owing to a disastrous first quarter in its leading economies. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	3	625	With interest rates most likely on hold for a while, "the focus has shifted to any developments regarding unconventional policies," said Capital Economics economist Jennifer McKeown. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	4	817	The ECB has already said it will buy 60 billion euros' (85 billion dollars') worth of covered, or collateralised, bonds, a move that should help restore cash flows in French, German and Spanish markets where such instruments are traded most widely. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	5	1075	Details are expected after a meeting of the bank's governing council. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	6	1154	But the amount corresponds to just 0.6 percent of the eurozone's gross domestic product, McKeown noted, whereas bolder moves by the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England are worth around 10 percent of their respective GDP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	7	1387	It also remains to be seen whether the ECB will "sterilise" the purchases by issuing its own debt or selling other assets, or whether it will just print new money, a move that could fuel inflation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	8	1594	The bank's priority is to keep inflation just below 2.0 percent, but it now faces the prospect of a broad-based fall in prices that could end in a deflationary spiral which could strangle economic activity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	9	1810	If businesses and individuals become convinced that prices will fall further, they postpone purchases, causing production to fall and raising unemployment, which can depress prices further. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	10	2009	Eurozone inflation hit a record low of zero in May, European Union statistics showed, and will likely turn negative in coming months owing to comparisons with the same period last year when oil prices spiked to record highs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	11	2243	But UniCredit economist Marco Valli said: "We don't think the ECB will be overly impressed" by the development, which has been forecast for several months. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	12	2408	ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet has stressed that short term price volatility is not a factor in the bank's decisions, and with oil prices on the rise again, a deflationary episode is unlikely to last long. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	13	2626	"The recent strong rally in oil prices makes the inflation picture more uncertain than just a couple of weeks ago," Valli said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	14	2763	"The central bank will continue to see the risk of deflation as very low," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	15	2857	The ECB can also point to indications that the eurozone's first recession has probably passed its trough even though the European Commission still expects the economy to contract by 1.9 percent this year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	16	3071	That leaves the thorny problem of credit growth, which according to the bank's figures continued to slow sharply in April. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	17	3203	"There is no easing in the very tight credit conditions that are facing companies and individuals," noted Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	18	3355	"Tighter credit conditions are a serious handicap to recovery prospects in the eurozone," he said, and raise pressure on the ECB "to take additional 'non- standard' measures." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0430	19	3540	Commerzbank analyst Rainer Guntermann felt "the ECB has not yet closed the door to more easing measures," but that an expansion of the already announced bond purchases in June was unlikely. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	0	58	Germany rescues Opel, for now 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	1	161	Germany has ensured that Opel's tens of thousands of workers will still have a job on Monday when its once-mighty US parent General Motors, as is expected, makes history and files for bankruptcy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	2	366	But Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to support with taxpayers' money a Kremlin-backed rescue may come back to haunt her, and could fail to prevent Opel crashing and burning further down the road, experts say. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	3	588	"All this seems to rest on a very fragile base. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	4	636	Let's say there is a 60 or 70 percent chance that it won't work," Juergen Pieper, an automotive analyst at Metzler Bank, told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	5	776	In a mammoth effort over recent months climaxing in a frenzy of activity last week, the German government agreed in the early hours of Saturday morning to back a takeover of Opel by a consortium formed around Canada's Magna. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	6	1010	Under the deal, GM would keep 35 percent of the company and Opel's workers would retain 10 percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	7	1110	Magna, which makes auto parts, would hold a 20 percent stake and state-owned Russian lender Sberbank 35 percent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	8	1232	Government sources told AFP that Germany would act as guarantor for around three billion euros (4.2 billion dollars) worth of loans, and the government would also itself make an emergency loan of 1.5 billion euros to Opel. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	9	1464	Magna meanwhile, which until recently was relatively unknown outside the auto industry, has pledged to cough up 300 million euros to keep the cash-starved Opel alive in the coming weeks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	10	1660	The Canadian firm, which thrashed out an eleventh-hour agreement with GM executives in a luxury Berlin hotel on Friday, has pledged to keep all Opel's German factories open and limit job cuts there to around 2,500. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	11	1884	But across Europe as a whole, where GM employs some 50,000 people including 7,000 in Spain and 4,700 at Britain's Vauxhall, the picture may be less rosy with Magna saying it plans to lay off one in five workers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	12	2105	Last week Germany came under pressure from Britain and Belgium not to save German jobs at the expense of workers elsewhere, and on Saturday Britain's biggest trade union Unite voiced concern about the fate of Vauxhall workers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	13	2341	It was also unclear whether Magna's intention to start making Opel cars at a factory in Russia owned by precious metals tycoon Oleg Deripaska's GAZ automaker would mean some production will be taken away from plants in the European Union. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	14	2589	Russian involvement also raises eyebrows because it strengthens the already strong business ties -- most notably in gas -- between Berlin and Moscow. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	15	2739	Critics say that these ties make Germany too soft on the Kremlin. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	16	2814	For analysts, it was September's elections in Germany that helped win Merkel over to Russian involvement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	17	2929	"Money doesn't smell at election time," said Andrew Wilson at the European Council of Foreign Relations think tank. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	18	3054	Magna and its Russian backers have their work cut out making the deal work, with Opel part of a global automotive industry that was already facing huge challenges even before the world economy hit the skids last year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	19	3281	Frank Schwope, an analyst at Germany's NordLB bank, predicted that the Canadian- Russian investors "will try everything, and then fail and Opel will be insolvent in two or three years." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	20	3476	Magna also has very little experience making cars -- unlike Fiat, which also wanted to snap up Opel but then got cold feet -- and the financial details of the deal are unclear. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	21	3662	Merkel admitted on Saturday that the road ahead is a rocky one. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	22	3735	"For Opel and Magna, the work is now just beginning and there are several difficulties still to overcome," she said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0431	23	3861	But cynics say that for the chancellor and her partners in the governing coalition, even if Opel does end up collapsing further down the road, it is mission accomplished: Opel will not be issue in September's vote.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0432	1	180	General Ould Abdel Aziz, who toppled Mauritania's government last year, said that no deal was near on delaying a controversial election scheduled to be held later this week. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0432	2	363	Supporters of Ould Abdel Aziz and the opposition have been holding talks with international mediators in the Senegalese capital Dakar, with sources on Saturday on saying an accord was close on resolving the political deadlock in the northwest African country. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0432	3	632	But Ould Abdel Aziz dismissed such talk. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0432	4	682	"A group of criminals is spreading these rumours and lies because they recognise their inevitable defeat at elections," he said at a campaign meeting on Saturday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0432	5	854	Ould Abdel Aziz often calls supporters of the main opposition parties criminals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0432	6	944	"We are not negotiating in Dakar with criminals and bandits but with the international community to ensure democracy and move forward on the path of change," he was quoted as saying by Mauritania's ANI news agency. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0432	7	1168	"The election is still planned for June 6," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0432	8	1231	Ould Abdel Aziz quit the military in April to run for president, and is widely expected to win if the vote goes ahead as he doesn't have serious contenders due to the boycott by the main opposition parties. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0432	9	1447	The intensive talks launched in Dakar on Thursday -- which include officials from the United Nations, African Union, European Union and Arab League -- have focused on postponing the election to allow the opposition to end its boycott and participate in the vote.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	1	195	Cancer specialists, gathered for an annual meeting, are reporting progress in the fight against lung cancer, the most common and deadliest form of cancer, but little progress in treating colorectal cancer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	2	410	Doctors and researchers at the 45th gathering of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) -- the world's main cancer conference -- on Saturday learned of two studies showing progress in the battle against lung cancer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	3	645	The first study showed how the combination of two anti-cancer treatments following standard chemotherapy can slow the advance of lung cancer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	4	796	Patients treated with a combination of Tarceva, sold by the Swiss drugmaker Roche, and Avastin, a drug by Roche's Genentech unit, saw their cancer growth slow more than a control group treated with Avastin. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	5	1012	More than 750 patients were randomized to receive Avastin and a placebo, or Avastin and Tarceva. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	6	1109	Those in the Tarceva group survived an average of 4.8 months before the cancer started growing again, compared to 3.7 months for the control group, said Vincent Miller, the study's main author. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	7	1312	The numbers translated to a 29 percent reduced risk of disease progression for patients who took a combination of Tarceva and Avastin. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	8	1456	"This is the first study to show that adding erlotinib (Tarceva) to maintenance therapy with bevacizumab (Avastin) delays disease progression in patients who have already received bevacizumab as part of their initial chemotherapy," said Miller. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	9	1710	A second study with 663 patients with advance lung cancer were given the drug Alimta, from US pharmaceutical Eli Lilly, which blocks cell growth. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	10	1865	Preliminary results showed that patients who took the drug lived 26 percent longer compared to a control group that took a placebo: 13.4 months against 10.6 months. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	11	2039	As in the first study, all the patients had already received four standard chemotherapy sessions. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	12	2146	"This study will change the overall standard of care," said Chandra Belani, the deputy director of the Penn State Cancer Institute, as she presented the research. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	13	2318	"Maintenance therapy with Alimta (permetrexed) offers a new paradigm for patients who have advanced lung cancer, because it has a low toxicity and can be given on an ongoing basis over a prolonged period of time to extend patients' lives," she said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	14	2577	However there were few advances to report in the fight against colorectal cancer, the fourth most common in the United States and the second deadliest type of cancer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	15	2753	Research on 2,710 patients with Phase Three colorectal cancer taking the drug Avastine along with standard chemotherapy treatment showed no difference in the survival rate or the recurrence of the tumor after three and a half years when compared to those not taking the drug. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0437	16	3038	Another study conducted in Italy among 747 patients with advanced colorectal cancer showed that the drug Eloxatine from the French firm Sanofi did not reduce the size of the tumor when combined with standard treatment used ahead of cancer surgery.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0438	1	187	A Malaysian Sikh family is demanding to be given the remains of their relative who Islamic authorities say had converted to Islam, in the latest "body snatching" case to hit the country. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0438	2	383	The family's lawyer said that religious authorities insisted Mohan Singh, a 41 -year-old art director who died of a heart attack last Monday, had died a Muslim -- a claim the family disputes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0438	3	584	His body has been kept at the mortuary of a government hospital in central Selangor state which has refused to release the remains to the family, lawyer Rajesh Kumar told AFP. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0438	4	769	"When he died, he was a practising Sikh, he never told anybody and nobody knew that he had converted to Islam, including family and close friends. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0438	5	916	His identification card to date stated that he is still a non-Muslim," Kumar said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0438	6	1008	"The family is very upset. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0438	7	1035	All they want is to claim the body and cremate him according to the Sikh rites," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0438	8	1135	The lawyer said that the Islamic authorities claimed Mohan, who had directed some local films, had converted to Islam in 1992 and was seeking confirmation of his conversion from an Islamic sharia court. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0438	9	1347	"Our contention is that at the time of his death, he was still practising Sikhism and even when his mother died three years ago, he performed the last rites for the mother according to the Sikh faith," said Kumar. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0438	10	1570	"He wouldn't be able to do so if he is a Muslim," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0438	11	1638	Conversion rows, including "body-snatching" cases when Islamic authorities have battled with relatives over the remains of people whose religion is disputed, are common in Muslim-majority Malaysia.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0440	1	172	The Fiji military regime, in its latest crackdown, has targeted the most influential religious group in the Pacific island nation, ordering the Methodist Church to cancel its annual conference. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0440	2	375	A joint statement issued by the military and police accused the church of trying to bring instability to the country. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0440	3	502	The crackdown follows information that "inciteful issues are going to be discussed at the conference", police spokeswoman Ema Mua confirmed to the FijiLive website. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0440	4	676	The statement said the Methodist Church could not hide its involvement in politics and part of the agenda for the August conference focused on the current political situation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0440	5	861	Earlier this month, a former Methodist Church president was detained after delivering a sermon calling for peaceful protests to restore democracy to Fiji. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0440	6	1025	Reverend Manasa Lasaro has been at the forefront of opposition in the Methodist Church to the 2006 coup in which military chief and self-appointed prime minister Voreqe Bainimarama overthrew the elected government. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0440	7	1249	Bainimarama has since ruled out democratic elections before 2014.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	1	183	Former top Chinese Communist official Bao Tong was purged for supporting the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, but he says his frustrations with the system started decades before. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	2	393	"China's people have wasted 60 years," Bao, now one of the country's top political dissidents, told AFP recently -- before authorities moved him out of Beijing to wait out Thursday's 20th anniversary of the deadly crackdown. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	3	627	His harsh assessment of the history of the People's Republic of China, founded in October 1949, is one few ordinary Chinese would dare to make. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	4	780	But the 76-year-old Bao, once a top aide to former Chinese leader Zhao Ziyang, is not your average citizen. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	5	897	He has spent the past 20 years either in jail, under house arrest or facing other restrictions in his small west Beijing flat, just one block from a major road where protesters battled tanks and troops. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	6	1109	He sees no sign of political openness on the horizon and says Beijing's failure to come clean on the events of June 3-4, 1989 and give justice to victims has been a key factor stunting democratic development. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	7	1327	"It has had a seriously negative impact. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	8	1368	It has made China a country with no voice.... a country in which no one can demand fairness," he said in the interview at his apartment. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	9	1514	"I am a sample on display," Bao says with a smirk, charging the government only allows foreign journalists to interview him to give the impression of openness, while preventing anything he says from being disseminated in China. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	10	1751	Bao was dragged down along with Zhao, who was ousted from his position as general secretary of the Communist Party for sympathising with the student protesters who had rallied for weeks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	11	1947	Zhao had opposed the use of force against the demonstrators, but was overruled by party hardliners. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	12	2047	Hundreds, and possibly thousands, were killed in the army crackdown. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	13	2125	Bao, who once directed a top Communist party political reform office, is still lean and energetic. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	14	2233	He now spends much of his time doing interviews with or fielding calls from foreign media on a phone whose ring tone is the Disney theme "It's a Small World." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	15	2401	Bao said China's current leaders bear no blame for what happened in Tiananmen Square -- and could earn great praise both at home and abroad on this anniversary by being more forthcoming. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	16	2597	"They are still the nation's leaders and I hope they can openly tell the Chinese people and the world what happened," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	17	2733	But the party's unwillingness to admit any mistakes will prevent that and the Chinese people are too intimidated to demand such honesty, he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	18	2889	Much of the blame lies with the rest of the world for refusing to push China to heal the wounds, said Bao, adding that other countries were increasingly hesitant to rile China due to its growing economic and diplomatic clout. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	19	3124	"Not wanting to offend China means they cannot help China, cannot help China's people attain their own rights, and cannot help the world community gain a reliable, stable, peaceful member," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	20	3332	"This is not a good thing." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	21	3369	As the Communist Party gears up to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, Bao said there was little to celebrate. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	22	3548	The party wasted a lifetime with collectivisation of the economy launched in 1953, only to come full circle with today's run-away capitalism. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	23	3699	"(We) have come back to the original point. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	24	3743	The work of 1.3 billion people has been wasted for 56 years," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	25	3823	"This is a crime greater than (the Tiananmen crackdown)." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	26	3890	Bao expressed delight with the May release in English of Zhao's memoirs, put together from secret tape recordings the deposed leader made while under house arrest. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	27	4054	His son, Bao Pu, is publishing the Chinese version of the book. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	28	4127	He said he hoped the book, likely to be banned in China, could somehow be distributed in the country and spark debate. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	29	4255	But he admitted the ghosts of Tiananmen would not likely be laid to rest any time soon due to the nature of a government for which he wishes he had never worked. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	30	4426	"I regret that I only realised all of this 20 years ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0441	31	4483	Why couldn't I have realised it 40 years ago or 60 years ago?"

AFP_ENG_20090531.0447	40	3746	-- On June 5, the day after the crackdown, a young man placed himself in front of a column of tanks, preventing it from passing down the Avenue of Heavenly Peace in the heart of Beijing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0447	41	3933	At one point he even mounted the front tank to appeal to its crew, but bystanders eventually dragged him away. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0447	42	4044	Photos and footage of the "Tank Man" immediately made top news around the world, and he went down in history as a symbol of peaceful and unarmed protesters confronting military repression.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	0	58	China faces dark memory of Tiananmen 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	1	169	Authorities in China are bracing for the 20th anniversary of the deadly June 4 crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square, a pivotal moment that still haunts the nation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	2	361	The way the government will likely mark the sensitive date on Thursday -- with deafening silence -- shows it is keenly aware of the emotional scars that remain after the army ended six weeks of peaceful rallies in central Beijing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	3	601	China's Communist leaders have made any discussion of the brutal quelling of the student-led demonstrations -- in which hundreds, maybe thousands, were killed -- taboo, but dissidents say the public could yet hold them accountable. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	4	842	"People remember this date because they want the Communist Party to take responsibility for the crimes it committed," said 53-year-old Qi Zhiyong, who lost a leg after being shot by troops near Tiananmen Square. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	5	1063	"It reminds them the party will resort to unbridled violence whenever it feels threatened." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	6	1164	In a bid not to rankle the wary authorities, the main public commemoration planned for Thursday will probably be silent. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	7	1294	Activist groups have called on citizens simply to wear white -- the traditional colour of mourning -- to honour those killed in the mayhem that erupted when tanks and troops rolled in to crush the protests. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	8	1510	The year 1989 was a disastrous one for communism across the globe and in China the ruling party found itself in a struggle with democracy activists who challenged its authoritarian rule over the world's most populous nation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	9	1744	The Tiananmen movement began in mid-April, when public grief over the death of former party leader and popular reformer Hu Yaobang gradually morphed into bold calls from students for political reform and steps to combat corruption. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	10	1985	Young students started to occupy Tiananmen Square, the symbolic centre of political power in China. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	11	2085	A sense of euphoria saturated the plaza as they took part in rallies no one would have thought possible just weeks earlier. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	12	2218	"There were banners everywhere. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	13	2250	This was the first unauthorised political demonstration in the (history of the) People's Republic of China," recalled one of the student leaders, Wang Dan. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	14	2415	Calls for democracy and freedom filled the square, thousands went on hunger strike, and one charismatic activist, Wu'er Kaixi, brazenly challenged Premier Li Peng during a meeting broadcast live on state television. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	15	2640	Indeed, the whole world was watching, as news crews from around the globe gathered in Beijing to cover the historic visit by then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, only to stumble upon an event that would be far more significant. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	16	2878	In the corridors of power, the protests drove a wedge between hardline leaders led by Premier Li and moderates headed by Communist Party general secretary Zhao Ziyang. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	17	3055	The hardliners won, with patriarch Deng Xiaoping, China's most powerful man, tilting the balance in their favour. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	18	3169	Zhao was removed from his post as party leader and spent 16 years under house arrest until his death in 2005. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	19	3288	The student movement was declared a "counterrevolutionary rebellion", and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army descended on the capital, crushing the democratic dreams of an entire generation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	20	3494	The number of people killed in the night of June 3-4 remains a mystery. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	21	3566	China's official death toll is 241, including 36 students. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	22	3625	Dissidents say thousands may have died. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	23	3674	The crackdown set off a wave of condemnation across the globe, and for several years China was treated as a near-pariah, as Western governments offered asylum to student leaders fleeing into exile. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	24	3881	The international community has long since welcomed China back into the fold, and Beijing's communist leaders have cemented their hold on power, transforming the country into the world's number three economy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	25	4099	But they have shown no willingness to change their position that the protests threatened Communist Party rule and had to be quelled in order to maintain economic reforms. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	26	4279	"Facts have proven that the socialist road with Chinese characteristics that we pursue is in the fundamental interests of our people," foreign ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu told journalists in May. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	27	4485	But, undeterred, victims of the crackdown have called for renewed international pressure on Beijing to reverse the official verdict on the quelling, saying failure to stand up to a rising China tacitly abets the repression. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	28	4718	"So far, the international community... has adopted a policy of appeasement towards the Chinese government," said Ding Zilin, 72, whose teenage son was shot dead by the army. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	29	4902	Bao Tong -- a former aide to Zhao who was jailed for seven years following the crackdown -- said the world has failed to push China to be more open about the events of Tiananmen because of Beijing's increasing global clout. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	30	5135	"Not wanting to offend China means they cannot help China, cannot help China's people attain their own rights, and cannot help the world community gain a reliable, stable, peaceful member," Bao told AFP recently. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	31	5357	"This is not a good thing," he added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0448	32	5404	Bao has since been ordered to sit out the anniversary at a resort more than 1,000 kilometres (625 miles) from Beijing -- evidence that the authorities in the capital are not yet ready to reopen the Tiananmen wounds.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	1	208	President Barack Obama's administration has asked the Supreme Court to reject a request by Chinese Uighurs held at the Guantanamo Bay prison and cleared of all charges to be released on US soil. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	2	412	The petitioners "have already obtained relief. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	3	459	They are no longer being detained as enemy combatants," wrote US Solicitor General Elena Kagan in the administration's filing to the Supreme Court Friday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	4	623	Kagan wrote that the men, members of a Turkic-speaking Muslim minority who fear persecution if returned to China, "are being housed in relatively unrestricted conditions given the status of Guantanamo Bay as a United States military base." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	5	872	Four years ago US authorities cleared the 17 imprisoned Uighurs, but they are stuck at the Guantanamo prison due to fears that Beijing would torture them if they returned to their homeland in northwestern China's remote Xinjiang province. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	6	1120	At the prison, the Uighurs are held at "Camp Iguana," a special area for detainees cleared for release. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	7	1224	They have more freedom and greater privileges than most other prisoners, including a recreational space and a library, according to the Pentagon. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	8	1379	In October 2008 a federal judge ordered that the Uighurs be released in the United States. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	9	1470	The most likely place for the detainees to be released would be in Washington's suburbs in northern Virginia, which is home to a significant Uighur expatriate community. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	10	1649	A federal appeals court in February however overturned that ruling. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	11	1717	It is the Uighurs' appeal to that decision that the Supreme Court must now address. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	12	1810	But for the Obama administration, which is repeating some of the reasoning that his predecessor George W. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	13	1916	Bush used, "the decision whether to allow aliens abroad to enter the United States and if so, under what terms, rests exclusively in the political branches," according to the filing, which AFP obtained a copy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	14	2135	For the government, the "petitioners' continued presence at Guantanamo Bay is not unlawful detention but rather the consequence of their lawful exclusion from the United States under the constitutional exercise of authority by the political branches, coupled with the unavailability of another country willing to accept them," Kagan wrote. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	15	2484	The nine justices sitting on the US high court have not yet said whether they would examine the politically explosive case, and could announce a decision by June. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	16	2656	The legal case was filed by 14 of the 17 Uighur prisoners. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	17	2724	The Guantanamo camp was established by the Bush administration as an offshore prison for "war on terror" detainees.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0450	19	2939	The US navy established a base in Guantanamo Bay at the end of the 1898 Spanish- American War, then signed a long-term lease with the Cuban government.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0451	3	558	"We are starting to see an industry waking up to the fact that we've been out of the limelight," said Scott Steinberg, publisher of DigitalTrends.com, a game and gadget website with 40 million readers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0451	4	769	"E3 is the public face of the industry.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0451	7	892	Videogame sales grew through much of the financial crisis, but slid in March and April of this year, according to industry figures. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0451	8	1033	Analysts remain optimistic about videogames, citing surveys indicating players would rather cut back on other entertainment, such as movies or dining out. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0451	9	1197	Major videogame makers are playing it safe by rolling out sequels to hit franchises and freshening faded successes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0451	10	1322	French videogame star Ubisoft will show off "Assassins Creed 2" and "Red Steel 2" along with the latest in a line of popular "Rabbids" titles featuring zany animated rabbits.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0451	14	1928	Eagerly-anticipated sequels to be touted at E3 include "Mass Effect 2," "Bioshock 2," "God of War 3," and a "Modern Warfare" title likely to be a powerhouse in the "Call of Duty" franchise." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0451	15	2128	"What we are seeing is a shift toward higher quality, risk-averse publishing," Steinberg said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0451	16	2232	"Right now, if you are going to ask someone to pony-up 60 bucks for a title, even though you can argue they get 30 hours of game play, it has to be good." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0451	17	2396	Videogame makers are expected to continue a trend toward downloadable content (DLC) for titles as well as letting people play on the Internet as teammates or opponents. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0451	18	2574	"Online is a feature everyone is trying to exploit," said videogame analyst Mike Hickey of Janco Partners. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0451	19	2690	Microsoft Xbox, Sony PlayStation3, and Wii each offer arenas for online play. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0451	20	2777	"Publishers love it because they can capture an audience for a longer time, delay trade-ins and hold up pricing; then there is always the idea of micro transactions for downloadable content." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0451	21	2978	The makers of controversial but hot-selling "Grand Theft Auto" are to provide a look at DLC titled "The Ballad of Gay Tony."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0451	24	3360	Pressure is on Nintendo to deliver captivating titles for the Wii, which has been a sales sensation but could lose momentum in the absence of must-have new videogames to play on the consoles. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0451	25	3561	"Nintendo needs something; everyone is saying that," Hickey said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0451	26	3636	A MotionPlus gadget that makes Wii motion-sensing remote controls more precise is to hit the market during E3, and videogame giant Electronic Arts will preview athlete-themed golf and tennis titles that work with the gizmos.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	1	182	French videogame titan Ubisoft is turning E3 into a playground for "Rabbids," madcap videogame rabbits breeding fans throughout Europe and the United States. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	2	349	A team of Rabbids, accompanied by a street band from Romania, will "wreak havoc" outside an annual Electronic Entertainment Expo videogame industry extravaganza that begins Tuesday in Los Angeles. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	3	555	E3 attendees will be invited to hurl t-shirts and other tchotchkes given away at the event into a colossal faux toilet. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	4	684	Rabbids will heap offerings on a trash mountain of items that will be donated to charity or recycled after E3 concludes on Thursday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	5	826	The stunt is intended as levity as well as an unmasked promotion of an Ubisoft "Rabbids Go Home" videogame making an E3 debut. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	6	962	The Romanian band's music is featured in the fourth installment of an increasingly popular videogame franchise. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	7	1083	"Go Home" play centers of getting the wacky animated characters to snatch all the "human stuff" they can find and pile it high enough to reach the moon. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	8	1245	"They are like spoiled four-year-olds; distracted by everything," said Ubisoft game producer Adrian Lacey of the Rabbids team in southern France. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	9	1400	"They are the child in everyone; the rebellious creature that does all the things we don't dare do but would like to." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	10	1528	The Rabbid weapon of choice is a bathroom plunger, and antics in games includes cow hurling; pumping carrot juice into mouths, and demolishing portions of Paris by belching. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	11	1711	Lacey notes that "Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party" was the first videogame to let players control action with their butts. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	12	1842	Players sitting on Wii console balance boards lean and shift to steer Rabbits in a downhill sleigh race. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	13	1956	"What is true about the Rabbids is there are no regulations; go crazy and have fun with them," Lacey said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	14	2063	"He has an edgy humor." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	15	2096	The Rabbids franchise was launched in 2006, with each subsequent version outselling its predecessor. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	16	2206	Ubisoft has sold more than six million Rabbids videogames, with one million of those sales in the United States. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	17	2328	"We've seen the appeal just grow and grow," Lacey said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	18	2384	"We are not at the point where we are a 'Super Mario' yet, but it would be nice to get there." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	19	2488	Lacey laughingly equates the look of a Rabbid to "a sack of potatoes on two stumpy legs" and credits their unintelligible language to a team member prone to annoying people with strange sounds. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	20	2691	"He never looks ridiculous because he is," Lacey said of each Rabbid. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	21	2761	"It is one of those funny things." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	22	2805	The Rabbids appeal prompted French car maker Renault to feature the characters in advertising and Kraft to use them to promote Capri Sun brand drinks. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	23	2965	"We're always looking for inventive ways to keep the brand cool and relevant with our audience," said Capri Sun senior brand manager Vinay Sharma. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	24	3121	Rabbid fever has resulted in toys and figurines based on the characters. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0452	25	3203	"They should take over the world," Lacey quipped.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	2	389	The issue will hover over Monday's inauguration of new Salvadoran president Mauricio Funes in San Salvador and could cause a rift at the Organization of American States (OAS) general assembly in San Pedro Sula, Honduras on Tuesday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	3	630	US officials could not even rule out the possibility of Clinton's skipping the OAS meeting altogether if negotiators fail to agree on terms for bringing Cuba back within the 35-member organization's fold. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	4	844	The United States wants Cuba to free political prisoners and respect political freedoms for it to participate fully in the OAS, saying it is holding the body to the democratic principles enshrined in its own 2001 charter. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	5	1075	Other OAS members say that Cuba can be nudged toward democracy once inside the OAS. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	6	1168	Many members point out that the reason for Cuba's suspension in 1962 -- its role in the Cold War-era Soviet bloc -- does not apply today as the bloc no longer exists. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	7	1344	Even though Cuba itself rejects the OAS, analysts said, many countries want to use the issue to either push for a lifting of the decades-old US embargo on Havana or for their own private agendas, such as to embarrass the United States. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	8	1589	Since a popular US President Barack Obama took office in January, he has raised hopes among many of his southern neighbors that he will soon lift the embargo, even if he insists that Cuba first undertake democratic reforms. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	9	1822	"This is going to be a complicated challenge for her (Clinton) to deal with," said Michael Shifter, an analyst for the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington think tank. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	10	2000	"I sense the Obama people are a little bit nervous. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	11	2052	I think they're aware that it's a minefield, Cuba," said Shifter who pointed to the risk of a rift within the OAS. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	12	2176	And Clinton's stop in San Salvador "creates a certain dynamic," Shifter said, because the presence of a Cuban leader at the inauguration will mark the start of El Salvador's own moves toward full diplomatic ties with Cuba. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	13	2408	It will expose the US position even more because, under the previous US-backed right-wing government, El Salvador was the last Latin American countries not to have normal relations with Cuba, he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	14	2618	Shifter said he has heard that Cuban President Raul Castro is attending, but AFP was unable to confirm the information. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	15	2747	Asked if Clinton would meet with the Cubans at the inauguration, a senior US official said on the condition of anonymity: "We're not at the stage right now where the secretary would meet with Cuban officials." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	16	2966	Shifter said the OAS secretary general, Jose Miguel Insulza, as well as radical leftist Venezuela, Nicaragua and host country Honduras were driving the agenda to have Cuba readmitted to the OAS. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	17	3170	Instead of having Cuba as the burning issue, he said, the Obama team would have preferred to highlight a new era of US cooperation with leftist but pragmatic democratic governments like those in El Salvador, Brazil and Chile. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	18	3405	Her visit to San Salvador is symbolic of the shift because Funes brought to power the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation, former leftist guerrillas who fought the US-backed right-wing government in the 1980s civil war. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	19	3644	Chris Sabatini, an analyst with the Council of Americas, said the new administration is trying to show that the "tent of democracy is broad" even while a few leftist radicals remain in the region. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	20	3850	"It is an attempt to not so much isolate them (radicals) but to create a positive pole in the hemisphere of democrats that can't be easily labeled as just pro-US, but range across the ideological spectrum," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	21	4075	Sabatini also expected the consensus-driven OAS to come to some agreement on the Cuba issue, saying the current debate amounted to a "tempest in a teapot" and a distraction to important human rights issues. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	22	4291	On rare occasions, the OAS can vote on an issue, however. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	23	4358	A senior US State Department official told reporters late Friday "it's hard to say" when asked if a consensus would be reached. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	24	4495	Nor could he exclude the possibility that Clinton might have to skip the meeting. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	25	4577	"I can't answer that question," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	26	4627	Spokespeople at the OAS headquarters told AFP on Saturday that no resolution had been reached and that the senior diplomats were leaving Washington this weekend to continue their negotiations on the Cuba document in Honduras. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0453	27	4862	Clinton is due to depart for El Salvador on Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	0	58	US auto industry's future hangs in the balance 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	1	182	The US auto industry faces a day of reckoning Monday, with the looming bankruptcy of auto giant General Motors and an expected court ruling on the sale of automaker Chrysler to a group led by Italy's Fiat. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	2	397	The once mighty US auto industry is reeling from the downturned market and global economic crisis, which has prompted massive intervention by President Barack Obama's administration to prevent total collapse and a new body blow to a US economy already in recession. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	3	672	The government's rescue plan for GM could put as much as 72.5 percent of the country's biggest automaker under state ownership. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	4	809	With the hours counting down for GM, the company bondholders' Saturday deadline expired without indication on whether they support the group's new offer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	5	972	If they accept the plan, the bondholders would obtain the rights to buy an extra 15 percent of GM's stock at a low price. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	6	1094	They would also control 25 percent of the "new GM," after having supported the new company's creation in bankruptcy court. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	7	1226	Recalcitrant bondholders who opt for confrontation rather than cooperation "will get nothing or very little," an Obama administration official told reporters Thursday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	8	1403	Government-backed restructuring in bankruptcy court for GM, once the world's largest automaker, appeared all but certain ahead of a Monday deadline imposed by the Obama administration on the company to submit a viable restructuring plan or file for bankruptcy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	9	1664	It could take place as early as Sunday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	10	1713	Meanwhile, a US bankruptcy court judge in New York was widely expected to approve a deal between Chrysler and Fiat Monday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	11	1845	The third biggest US automaker has declared bankruptcy and is seeking a tie-up with Fiat in a plan presented as the only way to save the company from liquidation. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	12	2017	Developments at Chrysler could provide an example for restructuring at GM, which will similarly have to sell some of its brands and close many dealerships. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	13	2182	But the administration official said a 60- to 90-day timeframe was "better" for GM, contrasted with the fast-track process for Chrysler, which filed for bankruptcy protection on April 30. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	14	2379	"This is a much more complicated company than Chrysler, as a global company. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	15	2456	It's three times the size," noted the official. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	16	2513	The United Auto Workers (UAW) union said Friday its members ratified a deal to allow GM to radically cut costs and its debt load, clearing the way for a quick exit from the expected bankruptcy filing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	17	2723	GM also announced plans to retool an idled US plant to build small cars it had originally planned to import, and two more US assembly plants could potentially be saved. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	18	2901	The bankruptcy filing could also be sped up by a deal struck in the early hours Saturday after marathon talks that saw Canadian parts maker Magna and its Russian backers taking over GM's Opel. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	19	3103	The deal for GM's European operations, which was brokered by Berlin, amounted to a major development in the global rearranging of the auto industry. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	20	3261	GM employs some 50,000 people throughout Europe and Magna plans to cut about a fifth. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	21	3356	German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose government agreed to stump billions of euros (dollars) in loan guarantees and emergency loans to keep the ailing Opel afloat, acknowledged that talks over the future of GM Europe had sometimes been difficult. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	22	3613	Germany's Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck had even denounced what he called "scandalous" US negotiating tactics. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	23	3737	Yet despite what she called "huge mismanagement" by GM executives, however, a telephone call to Obama helped seal the deal, Merkel said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	24	3883	As for Chrysler, a new company could be born within days of approval for bankruptcy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	25	3968	The Treasury said it had transferred 6.9 billion dollars in public funds to New Carco, a newly created company to acquire Chrysler's "good assets." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	26	4125	If presiding judge Arthur Gonzalez rules against Chrysler, it faces a grim future, with a worst-case scenario being Fiat abandoning the tie-up and the US automaker going into liquidation, with massive job losses. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	27	4347	Legal appeals were expected if Gonzalez ruled in favor, meaning possible new delays. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0454	28	4432	Fiat has said it might back out if the transaction is not completed by June 15. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0455	0	58	Obama keeps promise with New York date 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0455	1	172	US President Barack Obama swept First Lady Michelle Obama off to a Broadway show on Saturday night -- to honor a promise made in the heat of his gruelling 2008 campaign. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0455	2	351	The Obamas flew to New York, not on the iconic presidential jet, but aboard a small military plane -- still dubbed Air Force One with the president aboard -- for a meal in Manhattan's West Village and a night at the theater. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0455	3	585	Republicans however immediately seized on the trip, accusing Obama of enjoying himself at taxpayers expense, as ordinary Americans battle the economic crisis and another iconic US firm, GM, struggles for survival. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0455	4	808	Obama, in a statement issued through a spokesman, said: "I am taking my wife to New York City because I promised her during the campaign that I would take her to a Broadway show after it was all finished." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0455	5	1023	The epitome of glamour, the Obamas earlier left the White House aboard his Marine One helicopter. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0455	6	1130	At Andrews Air Force base outside Washington, they boarded the plane, the president in a smart dark suit with no tie, and the First Lady in a black cocktail dress and heels. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0455	7	1313	After landing in New York, they helicoptered into Manhattan and motorcaded to the Blue Hill restaurant, before heading to the Belasco Theater and the Broadway revival of the August Wilson play "Joe Turner's Come And Gone." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0455	8	1545	Obama's Republican foes however tried to make political hay out of the president's date night. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0455	9	1649	"As President Obama prepares to wing into Manhattan’s theater district on Air Force One to take in a Broadway show, GM is preparing to file bankruptcy and families across America continue to struggle to pay their bills," the Republican National Committee said in a statement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0455	10	1934	The White House could not immediately put a price tag on the president's trip. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0455	11	2013	But US leaders, due to the tight blanket of security that follows them everywhere they go, never travel on commercial aircraft. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0455	12	2150	Earlier, on the weekend before he heads off on a major trip to the Middle East and Europe, Obama was seen cheering on the sidelines at his daughter Malia's soccer game.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	1	194	Scottish singing sensation Susan Boyle was dealt an unexpected blow Saturday when she lost out to a group of young street dancers in the final of the British talent show that made her a global star. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	2	402	Despite winning praise from the audience and the judges in her final performance on live television, the 48-year-old graciously accepted second place, saying the "best people won" and wishing the winners "all the best". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	3	631	Boyle enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame over the past two months after video footage of her audition piece for the show, "I Dreamed A Dream" from the musical "Les Miserables", was posted on video-sharing website YouTube. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	4	859	It has had about 100 million hits, brought her celebrity fans including actress Demi Moore and rock star Jon Bon Jovi and seen her feted in the media from the United States to China, Japan and Australia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	5	1072	Bookmakers made her the favourite to win, but after an unconvincing performance in the semi-final there were fears that the church volunteer, who lives alone with her cat outside Edinburgh, was suffering under the pressure. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	6	1305	However, in a live performance in the "Britain's Got Talent" final Saturday, Boyle proved the critics wrong and repeated her audition piece with gusto. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	7	1466	Judge Piers Morgan said it was the "greatest performance I've seen on the history of Britain's Got Talent -- you should win the competition, I loved it." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	8	1629	Boyle was up against nine other acts to win the show, which brings with it a cheque for 100,000 pounds (115,000 euros, 160,000 dollars) and the chance to perform for Queen Elizabeth II. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	9	1824	More than a million viewers cast their vote following the live performances, and in the end, Boyle lost out to a group of ten young dancers, named Diversity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	10	1982	Saxophonist Julian Smith came in third place. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	11	2037	After singing earlier in the evening, Boyle, wearing a grey-blue, long sequined dress, thanked all her fans. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	12	2155	"I want to thank people for all the support they've given me," she said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	13	2237	Asked if it was worth all the media pressure, she replied emphatically: "Well worth it!... 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	14	2328	I really feel at home on stage, I'm among friends." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	15	2389	Boyle put in a shaky performance of "Memory" in the show's semi-finals last weekend, singing occasionally out of tune and out of time, and some fans on YouTube had questioned whether she could handle the weight of expectations. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	16	2626	The British media had also reported some erratic behaviour over the past week, including how she had lost her temper in the foyer of the London hotel where she was staying prompting police to intervene. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	17	2838	Morgan said that she even considered quitting, describing her in his blog as a "frightened rabbit in headlights". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	18	2961	But his fellow judge Amanda Holden said after Saturday's performance: "I have never heard such powerful confident vocals." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	19	3093	Reports on Sunday suggested Boyle could make millions of pounds in the next year if she capitalised on her global success, with the News of the World saying one of the show's judges, music promoter Simon Cowell, had big plans. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	20	3329	"It's the biggest phenomenon I've ever seen out of any of my shows," Cowell told the newspaper, which suggested an album, a film of her life and a memoir were in the pipeline. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	21	3514	Asked about her plans on television after the show, Boyle said: "I hope to get an album out -- I'll just play it by ear." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	22	3645	She added: "What a journey -- unbelievable, and very humbling. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	23	3708	Thank you for everything." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0456	24	3744	Hoards of fans had gathered in her hometown of Blackburn near Edinburgh to watch the final and support Boyle, and Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond also congratulated the singer, saying she could "hold her head up high". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	0	58	Cricket: Twenty20 comes home to England 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	1	171	Cricket's newest format returns to its birthplace when England hosts the World Twenty20 from Friday with the event kicking off a bumper summer which includes one of the sport's oldest combats, the Ashes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	2	384	But, as with all the other forms of one-day cricket first played in England at county level, the 'mother country' has found herself having to play catch-up with the rest of the world. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	3	577	Originally conceived as a fun way of bringing new audiences, particularly those who couldn't watch cricket during the working day, into the game, Twenty20 has taken the sport by storm. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	4	771	Tournaments such as the Indian Premier League (IPL) are now far more lucrative per match for a player than five-day Test cricket, the traditional pinnacle of the sport. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	5	949	India, whose administrators were originally hostile to Twenty20 because they feared its commercial impact upon the 50-over game, won the inaugural global tournament in South Africa two years ago. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	6	1154	Nine members of that winning squad, which defeated arch-rivals Pakistan by five runs in a thrilling final in Johannesburg, will be coming to England. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	7	1313	But, in what above all other types of cricket is a game heavily weighted in favour of batsmen, India will be without master run-maker Sachin Tendulkar, who has now opted out of Twenty20 internationals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	8	1524	Generally short boundaries and fielding restrictions put a premium on big- hitting batsmen and in Yuvraj Singh they have someone who struck England's Stuart Broad for six sixes in an over in South Africa. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	9	1738	Tendulkar, who himself played in this year's IPL, warned it was important that openers Yuvraj and Gautam Gambhir were refreshed after failing to find top form in the IPL. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	10	1918	"I think the key would be how soon they can shed the fatigue factor," Tendulkar said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	11	2013	Wicket-taking bowlers are an invaluable commodity in a game where economy rates can go out the window and India look to have a promising pace attack. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	12	2172	Left-armer Rudra Pratap Singh, who took 12 wickets in South Africa in 2007, will be supported this time around by Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	13	2326	Pakistan, starved of international cricket at home after a terror attack on the Sri Lanka team bus in Lahore in March made the country a 'no-go zone', will fancy their chances of going one better this time around. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	14	2549	"I thought Australia would thrash them in the one-off T20 match in Dubai but it was the other way round and now, if Pakistan play to their potential, they can win the title," Pakistan great Wasim Akram told AFP this month. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	15	2781	Australia have dominated all forms of cricket during the last decade except Twenty20 and captain Ricky Ponting is determined to improve both his and the team's record. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	16	2958	"The past couple of games I've played have been very poor," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	17	3027	"In the two games in South Africa I made one in each. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	18	3081	It's not great form going into a World Cup." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	19	3135	Ponting gave Australia a scare when he sustained a hand injury during practice on Saturday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	20	3236	But he is still expected to take part - which is more than England captain Andrew Strauss. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	21	3336	The opening batsman has opted out of the tournament because he thinks he isn't a good enough Twenty20 player and the suspicion remains that England are more interested in the Ashes series against Australia that follows this event. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	22	3576	England have never won a major international one-day tournament and they will be without all-rounder Andrew Flintoff (knee), now replaced by uncapped leg-spinner Adil Rashid, while doubts persist over star batsman Kevin Pietersen (Achilles). 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	23	3827	But the IPL and subsequent international form of Ravi Bopara has shown England that there is life beyond "Freddie" and "KP". 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	24	3961	Sri Lanka and New Zealand have repeatedly punched above their weight in international tournaments and could do so again during a tournament that will take place at three of English cricket's most historic venues - Lord's, the Oval and Trent Bridge. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	25	4219	And the West Indies could yet put a largely disappointing tour of England behind them in this format. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	26	4330	Meanwhile South Africa, who won both of their two previous Twenty20s against Australia, are desperate to add a one-day title to set alongside their achievements in winning Test series in both England and Australia during the past 12 months. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	27	4580	Bangladesh and Ireland, who have both enjoyed shock wins on the global stage in the past, will dream of further upsets although, with both Scotland and the Netherlands taking part, there is also the capacity for some hugely lopsided results too. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0457	28	4835	For the first time the corresponding women's tournament will run in parallel with the main men's event, with both finals taking place on the same day at Lord's where, thanks in part to Twenty20, permanent floodlights are now a feature of the ground.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	1	186	US sprinter Tyson Gay signalled his World Championship intentions with the third-fastest 200m time ever on Saturday at the Reebok Grand Prix Athletics meeting. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	2	355	Gay, a treble world champion in 2007 whose 2008 Olympic season was wrecked by injury, won the 200m in 19.58sec. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	3	476	Only Jamaica's Usain Bolt, who won Olympic gold in Beijing in a world record 19.30sec, and Michael Johnson (19.32 at the 1996 Atlanta Games), have clocked faster times in the half-lap sprint. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	4	677	Gay, whose previous best for the 200m was 19.62 - in 2007 - said he thought 2008 sprint revelation Bolt would be "excited" by his time. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	5	822	"I would think he would be pretty excited," Gay said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	6	876	"This is good news for our sport. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	7	910	It's good for both of us. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	8	945	"I don't know when or if we'll actually meet for a race," Gay said of the possibility of facing Bolt before the World Championships in Berlin in August. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0458	9	1098	"But whenever it happens it figures to pretty good and pretty fast."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0463	2	364	The 25-year-old, who is the leading wicket-taker in the newest form of the game with 24 victims in 14 matches, is in the best form of his career. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0463	3	519	The lanky Peshawar-born paceman boasts a career-best 4-8 - the second best performance in T20 internationals behind New Zealand’s Mark Gillespie’s 4-7 against Kenya in 2007 - which helped Pakistan beat Australia in Dubai. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0463	4	750	"I want to do better than the last time," said Gul, who finished as the leading wicket-taker with 13 in seven matches to anchor Pakistan’s runners-up finish to India in the inaugural World Twenty20 held in South Africa in 2007. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0463	5	987	Gul said he sees the batsman-oriented Twenty20 cricket as a big challenge. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0463	6	1071	"Bowling in Twenty20 is a great challenge, but I am always up for it and I believe in attacking the batsmen from the first delivery to the last," he said.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	1	182	England have never won a major international one-day tournament and, even allowing for home advantage, it will be a major surprise if they come out on top in the World Twenty20. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	2	369	English one-day cricket has generally been based on the idea of the steady accumulation of runs, followed by a dash at the finish, and steady, containing bowling by medium-pacers who 'do a job' for their side. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	3	588	What recent tournaments have shown is the need for wicket-taking bowlers in an era where economy rates are of limited value, given how aggressive modern batsmen are, and batsmen capable of scoring quickly, particularly in the early overs of an innings. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	4	850	The loss through a knee injury of all-rounder Andrew Flintoff, a dynamic seamer with an ability to get reverse swing and, on his day, a hard-hitting batsman, would appear to have robbed the hosts of a genuine match-winner. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	5	1082	Meanwhile, star batsman Kevin Pietersen's Achilles injury, which ruled the South Africa-born shotmaker out of the recent homne one-day series with the West Indies, also remains a concern. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	6	1279	However, albeit in a 50-over format and against opponents who didn't seem too keen to be on tour, England won that series 2-0. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	7	1415	And emerging England quick Stuart Broad, himself a handy lower order batsman, believes that Flintoff's absence need not spell the end of England's victory hopes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	8	1586	"We've certainly won well without Fred in the past, but it's important we play good cricket," Broad said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	9	1701	"He's obviously a very important player for us with bat and ball but players step up and take responsibility when he's not here, that's very important. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	10	1862	"We need to gain confidence of winning without Fred so when he comes back into the side there will be a lot of belief and confidence there. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	11	2011	"Fred is the sort of bowler who gets thrown the ball in an important situation but when he's not in the side someone else gets given the ball and takes responsibility." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	12	2189	But apart from three wins over New Zealand last year, England have not beaten a major nation in Twenty20 cricket since levelling their two match series against the West Indies at The Oval in June 2007. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	13	2400	England's only win at the inaugural World Twenty20 in South Africa a few months later was against Zimbabwe, with the side losing to South Africa, New Zealand and India. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	14	2578	However, England's squad does now contain players with plenty of domestic Twenty20 experience in Hampshire all-rounder Dimitri Mascarenhas and Essex wicket-keeper James Foster. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	15	2764	And England coach Andy Flower believes Ravi Bopara can provide the solution to the side's longtstanding problems at the top of the order in one-day cricket which have been an issue since the international retirement of Somerset left- hander Marcus Trescothick. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	16	3034	"You must be able to adapt, have strong hitters and top-class batsmen up front," Flower said in an interview with the Big Hitter magazine. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	17	3182	"Ravi Bopara has shown what a class player can do at the top of the order, which you need against the new ball - not just lower order sloggers thrown in." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0464	18	3346	England captain Andrew Strauss is sitting out this tournament on the grounds that he does not believe himself to be a good enough Twenty20 player, with the leadership passing to Paul Collingwood.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0465	1	177	Scotland come into the World Twenty20 desperate to be, at the very least, competitive against the likes of Group C rivals South Africa and New Zealand after some worrying recent results. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0465	2	373	In April, the team returned from South Africa with its one-day status intact but without a place at the 2011 World Cup that many had expected them to secure. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0465	3	540	Roddy Smith, chief executive of Cricket Scotland, was frank in his asssement of the team's performance, telling the Scotsman newspaper: "There are no excuses. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0465	4	699	Quite simply, the team's performances have not been good enough." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0465	5	774	Scotland, like many nations outside the Test elite, have a constant struggle to retain players. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0465	6	879	While the ICC makes laudable efforts to give them more games, team members must decide whether they can afford to take time off from their day jobs, with only three Scotland players on full-time contracts. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0465	7	1094	But there were encouraging signs during a May 28 Twenty20 warm-up match against Bangladesh where Scotland, although losing by six wickets, did bat through their 20 overs. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0465	8	1274	Much will depend for Scotland on the form of captain Gavin Hamilton, who played for England on their 1999 tour of South Africa, and Zimbabwe-born batsman Ryan Watson. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0465	9	1450	He stood down as skipper after failing to guide the team to a top-four finish in South Africa, which meant they missed out on the 2011 World Cup in Asia. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0465	10	1613	"We are in a rebuilding phase and ... 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0465	11	1651	I know we have to give a number of players international experience over the next couple of years," Hamilton told the Cricinfo website. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0465	12	1796	"However, we have a fantastic and important summer of cricket ahead and it is vital we put in some good performances in the next few weeks." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0466	0	58	Cricket: Ireland set for tough Twenty20 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0466	1	171	Ireland will be looking to build on their reputation for causing cricket shocks in the World Twenty20 but they face some potentially gruelling encounters against the 'big boys'. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0466	2	358	During the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean, they famously beat Pakistan but the scale of the task facing them in this tournament was demonstrated when, during a warm-up match against New Zealand in Derby this week, they lost by seven wickets with three overs to spare. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0466	3	636	Given that Bangladesh, one of Ireland's group opponents (the others are India), took New Zealand to the last ball before losing in a warm-up match, the prospects do not look good for the Irish. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0466	4	839	However, Bangladesh are an unpredictable side when it comes to the big occasion. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0466	5	920	At the same, albeit 50 overs per side, World Cup where Ireland beat Pakistan, Bangladesh also famously defeated India. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0466	6	1048	Ireland coach Phil Simmons, the former West Indies batsman, has retained the bulk of the squad that won the recent World Cup qualifiers tournament in South Africa, with Jeremy Bray coming in for Andrew Poynter and Paul Strling taking over from Eoin Morgan. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0466	7	1314	Middlesex batsman Morgan has 'defected' to England, highlighting a perennial problem for Irish cricket in that their very best players, as was the case before Morgan with fellow batsman Ed Joyce, are always likely to 'cross the water' in search of greater professional opportunities and the chance to play five-day Test cricket. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0466	8	1652	Ireland though will be bolstered by the return of experienced bowlers Trent Johnston, Alex Cusack and Boyd Rankin. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0466	9	1776	And for all that India and Bangladesh will be expected to defeat Ireland, and comfortably too, both will have in the back of their minds the fear of becoming yet another famous scalp for the men in green. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	0	58	Cricket: Gloveman McCullum holds key for New Zealand 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	1	188	The weight of New Zealand's Twenty20 World Cup expectations rests heavily on the shoulders of Brendon McCullum and his burning desire to be recognised as the world's best wicketkeeper-batsman. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	2	390	The diminutive gloveman is the key element in New Zealand's game plan with his audacious batting at the top of the order and his lightning-fast reactions behind the woodwork. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	3	574	That the 27-year-old's name is often mentioned as a contender to inherit the mantle of Australian great Adam Gilchrist speaks volumes for his ability. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	4	734	In the Indian Premier League, the Kolkata Knight Riders valued McCullum at 700,000 US dollars, the biggest offer for a New Zealand player, when they snapped him up last year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	5	918	They were immediately rewarded when he launched the inaugural IPL series by smashing a record 158 off 73 balls and he ended the season with an average 62.66 with the bat at a strike rate of 204.35. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	6	1125	New Zealand's 2008 Player of the Year has also won high praise from Australia where a cameo McCullum performance helped New South Wales qualify for the Champions League Twenty20 tournament in October. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	7	1335	"There is no doubt having Brendon McCullum in your team increases your chances of a win, that is an undeniable fact," said Cricket NSW chief executive David Gilbert. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	8	1510	In the just-completed second IPL series leading up to the World Twenty20, McCullum's batting was below par by his usual standards, finishing with an average of 23.75 at a strike rate of 119.24. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	9	1713	But ominiously, McCullum was working his way into form as the World Twenty20 approached with two knocks in the 80s in his last four IPL innings. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	10	1867	In a side which struggles for consistancy, much is made of whether McCullum's best role with the bat is as a blockbusting opener or an aggressive middle-order hitter who can get New Zealand across the finish line. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	11	2090	Coach Andy Moles is adamant he will lead with McCullum in partnership with the emerging Jesse Ryder. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	12	2200	"Opening is Brendon's place," he said with memories still fresh of the way McCullum engineered a clean sweep over India in their Twenty20 two-match series in February. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	13	2377	McCullum carried his bat through both innings and in a dramatic finish to the second game he calmly stroked a single off the final ball to secure the win. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	14	2541	New Zealand will rely on that same McCullum calmness to get them through the World Twenty20, while the gloveman will be looking to enhance his own reputation as well as aiding his country. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0467	15	2739	"I want to be the best batsman-keeper in the world," he told the New Zealand Herald.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0468	1	185	Australia's man in a hurry David Warner can be grateful for the explosion in popularity of Twenty20 cricket. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0468	2	303	It seems the diminutive opening left-hander and T20 are a natural fit, such has been his extraordinary entry and impact on the stand-and-deliver form of the abbreviated game. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0468	3	487	Warner, 22, this year became the first player in 132 years to debut for Australia without playing first-class cricket, such was his prodigious reputation after clubbing a one-day record knock of 165 for his state New South Wales. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0468	4	726	Although not considered good enough to play Sheffield Shield cricket for NSW, he ripped into the South African bowling on his international Twenty20  debut, peeling off a rollicking 89 off 43 balls at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on January 11. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0468	5	980	Warner smashed seven fours and six sixes in his all-action innings to finish just 11 runs short of becoming only the second player after Chris Gayle to score a Twenty20 International century in his man-of-the-match performance. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0468	6	1217	Skipper Ricky Ponting compares Warner's rumbustious hitting with former master- blaster Adam Gilchrist. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0468	7	1330	"He hit some huge sixes tonight when I was out there, it was some of the sweetest hitting I've seen," Ponting said of Warner's cameo. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0468	8	1464	"It was like having 'Gilly' there again." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0468	9	1515	His new-won fame earned an IPL contract with Delhi Daredevils and a deal to use a unique two-sided bat. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0468	10	1619	Warner hit 163 runs off 132 balls faced in seven knocks for the Daredevils. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0468	11	1704	As the short-game batting sensation heads to the World Twenty20 he has racked up 177 runs in five innings for Australia at 35.40. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0468	12	1843	Warner has been described as pure cricket box-office and has developed an aggressive switch hitting style where he often uses the back of his bat or takes a right-handed stance to go after the bowling. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0468	13	2054	He generates enormous power from his strong forearms and uses his small stature to get underneath deliveries and hit them high in the air. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0468	14	2202	In one T20 match for his state this year, he smoked a six off express bowler Shaun Tait that landed on the roof of one of the Adelaide Oval stands. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0468	15	2359	"It's not like I'm trying to hit every ball into the next suburb," Warner says of his pyrotechnic batting. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0468	16	2466	"Basically, if it's in my area, I'm not going to hold back. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0468	17	2535	"If it's ball one or the last ball of the day, I'm still not going to hold back.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0469	3	626	Selected for the South African under-19 team in 2004, his cricket career seemed to hit a dead end and he admits he spent more time partying than working on his game in his first year or so after leaving school in Pretoria. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0469	4	858	He started attracting serious attention in the 2007/08 season with his economical bowling and effective pinch-hitting for the Titans in limited overs cricket, helping the franchise win both the 45-overs and 20-overs competition. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0469	5	1096	On Twenty20 international debut he top-scored with 48 against Australia with a frenzied mixture of wild hits and judicious bunts. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0469	6	1235	He swung his bat with such ferocity that one attempted pull shot flew off a top edge over point for one of his four sixes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0469	7	1367	Drafted into the South African one-day international side, he topped his side’s bowling averages and was the most economical bowler, twice taking three wickets in an innings in four appearances. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0469	8	1571	Snapped up by the Royal Challengers Bangalore, he became a regular member of the team that reached the final of the Indian Premier League.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0473	5	995	But he has been able to continue his Scotland career and now Hamilton hopes a new-look side can give a good account of themselves in a Group D also featuring South Africa and New Zealand. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0473	6	1192	"We're realistic about our chances of winning games, but if there's ever a game to win, it's Twenty20 because the whole thing can turn around in two or three overs," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0473	7	1376	"It's a case of having people playing well and hopefully catching teams on a semi-bad day." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0473	8	1477	Scotland face England in a warm-up match on Tuesday at Trent Bridge but Hamilton said his 1999 experience would not be something he would dwell on.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	0	58	Cricket: Broad looking for better headlines 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	1	175	England quick Stuart Broad goes into the World Twenty20 determined to make the most of a tournament often seen as a hiding to nothing for bowlers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	2	331	Broad, at 22 an improving paceman and a more than handy lower order batsman, is quickly becoming an important member of the England team. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	3	478	But it says something about the self-belief of the son of former England opening batsman Chris that his confidence was not dented permanently when, during the corresponding tournament in South Africa two years ago, he became the first bowler to be hit for six sixes in an over during a Twenty20 international by India's Yuvraj Singh in Durban. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	4	831	"Anyone can get hit," said Broad. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	5	865	"You can see that in the amount of Twenty20 cricket that is being played now. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	6	952	"They bring the boundaries in, they make it smaller and everyone wants to see fours and sixes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	7	1047	So, as a bowler, you've got to accept sometimes you're going to be on the receiving end. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	8	1145	"The important thing is how you bounce back, how you improve as a bowler and how you learn new deliveries and practice different skills. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	9	1291	"It's important, certainly at a young age, to learn from it, take it in your stride and turn everything into a positive. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	10	1421	"It was a chance to really improve me as a bowler and I couldn't be happier with the way the last year has gone." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	11	1544	England were off the pace in South Africa, failing to beat a major nation during a run of just one win in five matches. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	12	1673	But they will have home advantage on their side in a group that sees them take on Pakistan, losing finalists in 2007, and outsiders the Netherlands. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	13	1831	"I think hosting the event is a massive plus for us," said Broad. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	14	1897	"Twenty20 is really big in England on the domestic side so to be having the World Twenty20 is going to make the crowds even more excitable." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	15	2047	And while Andrew Flintoff's latest injury, a knee problem, has ruled the star all-rounder out of the tournament, Broad said it was time England stopped despairing when confronted with life without 'Fred'. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	16	2261	"When he's not in the side someone else gets given the ball and takes responsibility," Broad explained. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	17	2374	"I thrive on that extra responsibility and I certainly like taking the new ball. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0475	18	2455	We talk about the first 10 overs setting the tone and that's my job with Jimmy Anderson."

AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	1	183	England manager Martin Johnson admitted his side needed to show greater "urgency" against Argentina at Old Trafford this coming weekend after Saturday's 33-26 Twickenham defeat by the Barbarians. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	2	388	An England team shorn of its British and Irish Lions and boasting some unfamiliar combinations were 33-5 down against the star-studded invitational team before a late rally made the scoreline respectable. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	3	602	However, 2003 World Cup winning captain Johnson was worried by the way in which the Barbarians were able to score five tries, including one from in-form Wallaby flanker Rocky Elsom, the hero of Irish province Leinster's European Cup win, and two from ex-England wing Iain Balshaw. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	4	892	"We were hesitant at times and lacked intensity. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	5	941	We must play with higher intensity and put teams under greater pressure," Johnson said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	6	1038	"Defensively the way we gave away the tries was disappointing. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	7	1101	It was poor and our urgency wasn't good enough. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	8	1158	"We can't make the same sort of mistakes against Argentina. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	9	1218	Some of the guys hadn't played for a while and we'll have to be sharper," the former lock added. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	10	1324	"We'll be picking our strongest team against Argentina." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	11	1390	Ex-England captain Martin Corry, who played with Johnson at Leicester and fellow World Cup winner Josh Lewsey, whom the legendary second row captained to glory in 2003, both played for the Barbarians on Saturday as they made their final Twickenham appearances before retirement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	12	1678	Back-row forward Corry said it would be wrong to make too much of this result. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	13	1757	"The way England finished was key. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	14	1792	Everyone looks at the Barbarians as a scratch side but so were England," he said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	15	1883	"Thankfully it was our talent that got us through but England have some very smart players who picked holes in us. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	16	1998	They were very impressive. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0478	17	2034	"This is tough for Johnno because he has got to start again, as this is not the same side that finished the Six Nations." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	0	58	Football: Cahill pride despite Everton's final misery 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	1	185	Australia midfielder Tim Cahill insisted Everton had no reason to be ashamed after losing the FA Cup final to Chelsea. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	2	313	Cahill choked back tears on the Wembley pitch after Saturday's 2-1 defeat but the Socceroos star had no intention of feeling sorry for himself for long. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	3	475	Although Everton were briefly within touching distance of winning their first trophy for 14 years after Louis Saha gave them the lead just 25 seconds into the match, it was Chelsea who finished with the victory lap of honour. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	4	710	The ecstacy of Saha's strike - the fastest goal in FA Cup final history - was replaced by agony as Didier Drogba equalised before the break and then Frank Lampard hit the second half winner. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	5	910	Defeat was especially hard for Cahill to take as he had already lost one FA Cup final with Millwall against Manchester United in 2004. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	6	1054	But the 29-year-old, the first Australian to play in two FA Cup finals, took heart from the way his team-mates had dug deep to reach the final despite injuries to key players like Mikel Arteta and Ayegbeni Yakubu. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	7	1277	"The best thing about this team is we stuck together, no matter what," Cahill said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	8	1370	"We've come so far with such a small squad and I'm just proud to be part of this team and wear this shirt. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	9	1486	"I'm just gutted because this was a chance to win some silverware. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	10	1562	"But we lose as team and win as a team. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	11	1602	We're going to hold our heads up high and take this on the chin. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	12	1676	"We've had such a long season with such a small squad. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	13	1731	I can't be happier playing with a group of lads like this. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	14	1790	I just hope everything stays the same for next season." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	15	1855	As Cahill hid his face under his shirt at the full-time whistle, he was consoled by Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink, who grew to admire the midfielder during his spell as Australia coach. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	16	2049	Cahill was a key figure as Australia reached the last 16 of the 2006 World Cup under Hiddink and he was keen to share a few words of encouragement with his former player. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	17	2229	"I have a special relation with Tim Cahill," Hiddink said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	18	2288	"When I started working with the Australians they didn't have the confidence to qualify for the World Cup. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	19	2395	He was one of the key players in that squad. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	20	2440	You could use him anywhere. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	21	2477	"I was happy he missed the chance he had (in the final) but it was typical Tim to get in there. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0479	22	2573	He is a big player and a big personality and a very beautiful player in the Premier League." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	0	58	Football: Cup Final hero Lampard salutes Hiddink 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	1	180	Frank Lampard described Guus Hiddink as managerial genius after the Dutchman guided Chelsea to victory in the FA Cup final before saying an emotional farewell to England. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	2	360	Hiddink, who has been temporary manager at Chelsea for four months, is due to fly to Moscow this week to resume his role as coach of the Russian national team having made a big impact in west London. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	3	569	Chelsea were in turmoil when he first arrived, having just sacked manager Luiz Felipe Scolari following poor performances in the Premier League and a highly- public falling out with star striker Didier Drogba. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	4	788	But Drogba, left to train with the youth team by Scolari, completed a remarkable turnaround in fortunes as he scored one of the goals in Saturday's 2-1 victory over Everton in which Lampard hit the winner. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	5	1003	The result ended two years without a trophy for Chelsea, who are hotly tipped to name AC Milan's Carlo Ancelotti as their next manager despite the popularity of Hiddink who has always maintained his commitments with Russia made it impossible to stay. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	6	1263	Lampard said: "Some people think that's bewildering but it's not. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	7	1329	It was always going to be until the end of the season so we understand. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	8	1401	But he's been absolutely fantastic to work with, every player will tell you that. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	9	1492	"The way he works on the training ground, how simple he keeps football is something that is managerial genius. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	10	1603	It's been a pleasure to work with him. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	11	1651	"It's sad to say goodbye but he got a couple of gifts from us all on Friday, just as a gesture. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	12	1747	We all feel the same and feel very close to him. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	13	1796	I don't want to sound too romantic about it all but that's true!" 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	14	1871	Hiddink has left such a big mark on the Chelsea squad that many feel he will be a tough act to follow, even for a manager of such immense experience as Ancelotti. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	15	2043	Lampard added: "I think that's true but anyone who comes into a Chelsea job knows it's a huge job. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	16	2142	Success is what everyone craves here and quite rightly so with the squad and the investment that here. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	17	2254	"So yes the new manager will have a hard act to follow but I'm sure he will have credentials that will take the club forward." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	18	2390	Drogba has more reason than most to be nervous of what the future holds at Stamford Bridge, especially as he is currently waiting to see what punishment he will receive after being charged by UEFA for his behavior following the Champions League semi-final against Barcelona. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	19	2674	But he was given a rousing reception by Chelsea fans at the final whistle at and has yet to discuss his long-term future. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	20	2805	"The fans have been supportive to me," he insisted. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	21	2857	"The only thing I have to worry about is what happened after that match. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	22	2930	But I'm delighted to finish the season the way we have." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	23	2996	Drogba has been revitalised under Hiddink and was impressive again at Wembley as Chelsea came back from conceding an opening goal to Everton's Louis Saha after just 25 seconds, the fastest goal in FA Cup Final history. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	24	3224	It was Drogba who headed Chelsea level - his fifth goal in a major final for the club - before Lampard's wonderful left-foot strike arrowed into the net for the winner in the second half. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	25	3421	Drogba said: "It was a difficult start but you have to say it was a very good goal. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	26	3505	But our strength is to believe in ourselves and our qualities and we played with more confidence. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	27	3603	That's why we won." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	28	3632	Drogba also paid tribute to the effect Hiddink has had on Chelsea since he replaced Scolari. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	29	3734	He added: "I think the discipline between us was always good. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	30	3796	You don't win six or seven trophies in five years if you don't have discipline in friendship. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0480	31	3890	But the manger has given us an extra bit." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	0	58	Football: Hiddink dances into the sunset with a message for Chelsea 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	1	199	Guus Hiddink admitted Chelsea's riotous dance party after the FA Cup final was the perfect way to end his brief reign, but the departing Blues manager wants his side's victory over Everton to signal a more sedate period at Stamford Bridge. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	2	448	Hiddink joined Chelsea's stars in a wild dressing room celebration at Wembley on Saturday, which saw even Roman Abramovich lose his inhibitions and throw a few shapes alongside Michael Essien, John Obi Mikel and company. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	3	678	A first trophy for two years does that kind of thing to a club who had grown used to such occasions during Jose Mourinho's reign. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	4	817	But, while Hiddink was delighted to savour every moment of a perfect farewell before resuming his role as Russia coach on a full-time basis, the Dutchman believes it is the Mourinho era that Abramovich must recreate if Chelsea are to enjoy more champagne-soaked celebrations in the future. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	5	1116	Since Mourinho was eased out after a bitter power struggle in September 2007, Chelsea have been through three managers and Abramovich is set to appoint a fourth, most likely AC Milan's Carlo Ancelotti, in the next week. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	6	1345	Hiddink believes that constant change has had a negative effect on the players and he wants Abramovich to stick with his new man for the good of the squad. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	7	1510	"We had a nice dance party with everyone participating, the players and the staff," Hiddink said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	8	1608	"We have a multi-cultural squad and you must see the African players; to see Essien break-dance is a joy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	9	1723	"I did some good moves, the African way. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	10	1764	At least that's what I was thinking! 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	11	1810	"Roman danced with us. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	12	1833	He is not a man of many words but he was in the middle of the party. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	13	1911	"It was emotional in the dressing room because we were aiming for this cup. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	14	1996	"We had this beautiful African dance, then I gathered the players and technical staff in another room because I won't get another opportunity now to speak to them. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	15	2169	"I gave a five minute speech to thank them in a rather emotional way for the way we have worked together in the last four months. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	16	2308	"Now I think stability is a big need for the club. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	17	2359	They have had too many changes in the past years and they recognise that themselves. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	18	2453	"They need a long-term strategy so that they can build a team and keep up their high performance. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	19	2560	"The players know what they are capable of. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	20	2604	This victory might be the foundation for the future. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	21	2657	They have shown they can do it." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	22	2699	After falling behind to Louis Saha's 25 second opener, the fastest goal in FA Cup final history, Chelsea gradually overpowered Everton. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	23	2844	Didier Drogba equalised with a header from Florent Malouda's cross in the 21st minute and Frank Lampard gave Chelsea their fifth FA Cup when he drove a long- range shot past Tim Howard after 72 minutes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	24	3056	Hiddink refused to rule out managing another Premier League club, or even Chelsea, in the future, but for now he will visit his father before focusing on leading Russia to the 2010 World Cup finals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	25	3264	He will always have a place in the hearts of Chelsea's players and fans after one of the most successful caretaker manager spells of all-time. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	26	3416	When Hiddink replaced Luiz Felipe Scolari in February he took over a squad in danger of stagnating, but his direct, open approach produced a run of just one defeat in his 22 matches. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	27	3608	And were it not for some dubious decisions by referee Tom Henning Ovrebo in the Champions League semi-final second leg against Barcelona, Hiddink would have taken Chelsea to two finals. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	28	3803	He admitted that controversial defeat was the only disappointment of his time in England. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	29	3902	"It would have been even more perfect if we had been somewhere a few days ago playing in another big final," Hiddink said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	30	4034	"That is the only regret I have. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	31	4067	I would have loved to play Man Utd in the Champions League final, but it did not happen. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	32	4165	"I feel sadness to be leaving because the attitude from everyone was superb. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0481	33	4242	On the other hand leaving with silverware gives a feeling of satisfaction.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	0	58	Football: We'll be back vows Moyes after Cup Final heartache 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	1	192	David Moyes insists Everton must use the pain of their FA Cup final defeat against Chelsea as motivation for success next season. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	2	331	Moyes' side were unable to take silverware back to Goodison Park for the first time in 14 years despite the boost of Louis Saha's record-breaking first minute strike at Wembley on Saturday. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	3	530	Saha gave Everton a shock lead just 25 seconds after kick-off, claiming the record for the fastest ever FA Cup final goal in the process. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	4	677	But even that didn't shake Chelsea out of their stride. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	5	733	Guus Hiddink's team methodically worked their way back into the game and equalised through Didier Drogba before Frank Lampard drove home the second half winner. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	6	903	Moyes cut a dignified figure after the match as he insisted Chelsea were deserved winners, but deep down the Blues boss was feeling the pain more than anyone. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	7	1071	He knew how significant a Cup Final victory would have been in his attempt to establish Everton as a major threat to the Premier League's big four. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	8	1228	But the numbing sense of a missed opportunity couldn't totally dampen Moyes' desire to emphasise that Everton are still within touching distance of success. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	9	1394	"I said last year when we got the League Cup semi-final and lost to Chelsea that the next step was to get to a final. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	10	1512	Well, we've got to a final beating Manchester United, Liverpool and Aston Villa on the way," Moyes said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	11	1626	"The next bit will hopefully come next year and we'll win a cup. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	12	1700	"We know it's really hard to win things in England, with so many teams fighting for just a few prizes. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	13	1812	"But for us to finish fifth and reach the FA Cup final, then come here and not look out of place was a great achievement. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	14	1934	We played Chelsea twice this season and drew and this was only 2-1. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	15	2011	"I'm really keen that the players are recognised for how well they have done this season because they have been outstanding." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	16	2146	While Moyes rightly takes great heart from his team's achievements, he knows it will take a stronger squad to make the transistion from nearly-men to big-game winners.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	18	2597	"If Chelsea had gone into this game without Lampard and Drogba it would have given us a better chance. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	19	2700	And we went in with Jagielka, Yakubu and Arteta. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	20	2749	They are the equivalent players for us as those Chelsea players," Moyes said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0482	21	2836	"Players like Drogba, Lampard and (John) Terry are the people who win you cups.

AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	0	58	Football: Rangers on holiday, happy with domestic double 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	1	189	Rangers assistant manager Ally McCoist said he was looking forward to his summer break after a Nacho Novo wonder strike won the Scottish Cup as the Gers secured a domestic double. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	2	378	The Ibrox side's narrow 1-0 victory over a battling Falkirk side means Rangers can add the Scottish Cup to the Scottish Premier League championship they won on the final day of the season. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	3	576	It brings to a close a long season for the Ibrox side which begun with a Champions League qualifier against FBK Kaunas on July 30 last year. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	4	726	The Glasgow giants, who the season before had reached the UEFA Cup final, suffered a painful elimination from Europe at the hands of the Lithuanian minnows. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	5	892	And while McCoist says the club will look to buy more players in the summer, the fact they put the disappointment of the Kaunas defeat behind them to secure a league and cup double was testament to the effort the players had put in since he and Walter Smith returned to the club in January 2007. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	6	1197	"It can always get better in terms of the team and the squad. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	7	1259	With a bit of luck we can maybe add to that and look to strengthen," McCoist said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	8	1351	"But in terms of what the boys achieved in the last two years the team deserve all the credit going. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	9	1461	"Last year was so close to being the best season in the club's history. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	10	1533	It ended up being, in many people's eyes, a disappointment when we lost the league on the final day. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	11	1643	"We can sit and talk about it all day if we deserved or we didn't deserve it. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	12	1721	The fact is we didn't win it. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	13	1760	"I just felt that this year it was a real reward for the players." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	14	1836	McCoist added: "I am absolutely looking forward to my break like you have no idea. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	15	1919	I've got the golf clubs looked out and hopefully I'll take a few quid off the manager in the summer. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	16	2029	"I think the players will be looking forward to getting away from us more but they really need a break, especially with last season when they didn't get as much of a break as we would've liked." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	17	2233	McCoist also heaped praise on striker Novo, who scored 36 seconds after coming off the bench at half-time. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	18	2349	The Spaniard collected a Sasa Papac throw-in to send a sensational strike past Falkirk keeper Dani Mello from 30 yards out as the Ibrox side lifted the Scottish Cup for the 33rd time. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	19	2542	And McCoist, himself a legendary striker with the Gers, said it was a goal worthy of winning any cup final. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	20	2659	"It was very good. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	21	2678	Looking at the context of the game and the quality of the goal it will take some beating," McCoist said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	22	2783	"It's certainly one of the great goals to win any cup final in any country I would think. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	23	2882	"I can still see it. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	24	2903	I was actually praying he would hit it as he got himself that wee half yard in front and I thought, just have a hit and see what happens, and I knew it would be close. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	25	3080	"Nacho is just an incredible wee guy. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	26	3118	He's got a wonderful rapport with the fans and the rest of the squad. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	27	3197	"He deserves his success because he works so hard every day in training. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	28	3279	"Anywhere lights up when the wee fellow walks in, whether it's onto a football park or into a room, he‘s just that kind of person. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	29	3419	"If anyone deserves the success it's him as it's not easy when you're on the bench." 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	30	3513	And after securing his fourth double while in charge of the Glasgow giants manager Walter Smith said he would be in charge next season to collect more trophies, despite speculation to the contrary. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	31	3720	"Certainly in Glasgow you are surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of rumours. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	32	3798	You obviously just have to wait and see what happens," Smith said. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	33	3874	"Going upstairs today (to collect the Scottish Cup) is the kind of thing I wanted to do when I came back to Rangers. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	34	4000	"They are the kind of stairs I want to walk up. 
AFP_ENG_20090531.0484	35	4048	That's why I came back."

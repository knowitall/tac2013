ADB warns climate change could spawn mass migrations
By Associated Press, Updated: Tuesday, March 13, 2:13 AM

MANILA, Philippines  The Asian Development Bank is warning countries to prepare for influxes of people fleeing natural disasters as climate change exacerbates rising sea levels, soil degradation and flooding.

Natural disasters drove 42 million people from their homes in the Asia-Pacific in 2010 and 2011, though it was unclear how many of those were caused by climate change.

The study released Tuesday says one-third of Southeast Asias population lives in at-risk areas, including Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.

Six of the 10 countries most vulnerable to climate change are in the Asia-Pacific. Bangladesh tops the list followed by India, Nepal, the Philippines, Afghanistan and Myanmar.

1. Neanderthal alert. All non-believers (of climate change) are now about to face the truth.

2. But what IF

Filipinos are just being drama kings &amp; queens? They could just be putting on a show because they want the world to feel sorry for them. They have a handy excuse, with the so-called climate change ruse.

4. It's a HOAX, perpetrated so that they can...

I can never think of anything to write after "can" <img src="http://www.democraticunderground.com/emoticons/silly.gif"/>

3. Can we slow down?

Every day we continue we are literally shortening someones future life. Be nice if people would think about that the next time they have to fly, drive or buy the latest goods &amp; gizmos from China.
I guess we should just give up and join in the fossil fuel frenzy but then I think maybe I'd like a kid tomorrow to have one more breath without horror. Maybe that is worth more than a golfing trip to Florida.

5. Some of these mass migrations will occur right here at home in the U.S.A...

...and the less damaged states will pull up the welcome mats, turn out the porch lights, and lock the doors.

three years ago?

And that's just the official report. A leaked report said pretty much the same thing in 2004.

7. Actually, I believe they did a study back in 1978 saying it would happen and planned around it.

I don't remember the name of the document, but it's surfaced a few times to be commented on by others who knew about it. Mostly on conspiracy websites, but they actually had worked out scenarios for it just like they do for everything else.

WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - For the nearly 5 million people who live along the U.S. coasts from Maine to the Gulf of Mexico and the West Coast, rising seas fueled by global warming have doubled the risk of so-called once-a-century floods, according to a trio of environmental reports released on Wednesday.

These new reports - one from the non-profit group Climate Central and two others published in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Research Letters - offer a detailed picture of where the most severe risks are along coastlines of the contiguous 48 states.

Based on 2010 U.S. Census population data and a fresh analysis of high tide lines by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Climate Central report's findings can be seen online at surgingseas.org

South Florida may be "indefensible" against floods caused by higher seas and the bigger storm surges that are expected to result, said Ben Strauss, an expert on ecology and evolutionary biology who is chief operating officer of Climate Central. He co-authored the two journal reports and the online report.

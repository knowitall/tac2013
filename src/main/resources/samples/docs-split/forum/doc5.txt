Bradley Manning's treatment was cruel and inhuman, UN torture chief rules
</headline>

Source: The Guardian UK

The UN special rapporteur on torture has formally accused the US government of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment towards Bradley Manning, the US soldier who was held in solitary confinement for almost a year on suspicion of being the WikiLeaks source.

Juan Mendez has completed a 14-month investigation into the treatment of Manning since the soldier's arrest at a US military base in May 2010. He concludes that the US military was at least culpable of cruel and inhumane treatment in keeping Manning locked up alone for 23 hours a day over an 11-month period in conditions that he also found might have constituted torture.

"The special rapporteur concludes that imposing seriously punitive conditions of detention on someone who has not been found guilty of any crime is a violation of his right to physical and psychological integrity as well as of his presumption of innocence," Mendez writes.

"Regardless of what it may be called"- I'm glad Mendez has made this point as our gov't is constantly trying to rename things to make them more palatable even though they are horrible things.

2. Agree.......

Obama says repeatedly that he stopped the practice of torture but there continue to be reports of the continuation of extraordinary renditions, etc. not to mention the treatment of Manning.

I guess Obama's DOJ doesn't consider solitary confinement prior to conviction torture. I would suggest it is.

3. It's not just Bradley Manning

Low estimates are that there are at least 20,000 people in solitary confinement in high-tech dungeons like the federal Supermax prison in Florence, CO, and the rancid Pelican Bay complex in northern California.

The ACLU considers solitary an abuse of human rights:

5. I have seen other

threads in which it is reported that Manning was stripped of his clothing and required to sleep only an hour at a time in a naked condition. That plus I've seen an interview with a person who is a friend on Keith and I strongly suspect that Bradley Manning may very well be gay and wonder if some of this punishment is tailored to that possible aspect of him.

10. It would seem that interviewing Manning or his lawyer might lend a bit of credibility to his press

release.

Here's the thing--if Manning was tortured, I would expect interviews from him and his lawyer, and a careful review of his Article 13 claims. Of course, Occculus, you have reviewed the Article 13 claims and motions of the defense counsel, have you not?

Quantico is a single-cell confinement facility. Too bad Mendez chose not to visit him.

<post author="go west young man" datetime="2012-03-12T13:05:00" id="p15">
12. He asked to visit him unmonitored.

Quantico denied the request. The UN special rapporteur ask's all countries for unmonitored visits. That way it can be ascertained if he was mistreated without worry of retribution from the confining authority. To spin your words. "Too bad the United States (chose) not to comply with his request". All the pressure did bear fruit in the end as Manning was transferred to a medium security facility. Too bad it took so long and so much handwringing. The whole confinement debacle has just put one more stain on the already tarnished reputation of the United States and our armed forces.

Of course he cannot visit Manning unmonitored...why should he get special privileges? Privileges that no other prisoner in US custody gets???

What surprises me is that not one of his followers has asked these questions:

1) Why hasn't the lawyer been interviewed?

2) Why hasn't Manning claimed torture in his article 13 filings???

39. I see and understand you believe fully in the US law.

However, the UN is the international deliberative body for the entire world. Every country has it's own laws. They are not all just. As a matter of fact many of them are completely different than each other. Great Britain, for example, has no plea bargaining and actually considers the U.S.' use of it a travesty for justice. The UN attempts to deal with all these differing systems and asks all countries for the same courtesy. In this regard the U.S. is not special even though you believe it to be. It's a paradox as the U.S. should aim to set a higher standard so that other countries would follow. I would argue that your defense of this practice by our country is actually not in the interest of the United States. Other countries will now follow our poor example and we will be worse off for it. As will be future U.S. prisoners of war.

57. It is not a matter of "courtesy"

there is a specific UN treaty that permits unsupervised visits by the UN special envoy on torture. The US did not ratify that treaty - we have no obligations under international law.

The UN has no place interfering with the US judicial system.

11. Vote a straight democratic ballot?

Not that I object to doing so, in fact, I intend to do mostly that, primarily for ideological reasons - principle. I'm confused though, as to why anyone thinks that would make a difference in such cases. Do you think Obama could halt or change the treatment of Manning even had he wished to? Executive power is not all it's cracked up to be. There are forces in the military, within the MIC, that even the President must be wary of. He may be Commander in Chief, but he is neither King nor dictator. He is simply the Chief Commander - first among equals. To the extent of my knowledge he does not have military experience either (correct me if I'm wrong). I imagine he relies mainly on what his experts, his generals tell him.

It was not just the Republicans that allowed for this treatment, it has never been so. Democrats, even some of whom we admire allow this to continue because they either believe things are being done appropriately, or are afraid to take on the MIC. Accidents happen, even to the most wealthy and powerful officials. Keep in mind we still have no clue who actually killed JFK, or why they really did so - plenty of theories, but nothing concrete.

If we vote a straight democratic ballot, it will help in numerous ways - particularly if we manage to elect more progressives. If you think though, that it will change treatment such as this... I suggest not holding your breath.

Many members of the armed services are furious with Manning. They feel that he betrayed his oath, betrayed them, possibly leaked information that could endanger a number of lives. I find that it is particularly those who have served in the field that feel this way, regardless of their political leanings. Never having served myself, I can't expect to understand their feelings of betrayal or why many of them feel that no amount of punishment is undeserved.

Personally though, I object to how he has been treated on a matter of principle. Military or not, time of war or not, there are legal protocols that should be followed in such cases. Regardless of his alleged crimes, the man remains a citizen, entitled to certain rights - to a certain manner of treatment. In a high profile case such as this (or, for that matter, in any such case), charges should be first be made, then, whether a jury trial or a military tribunal, there are protocols to follow. We should not even treat our worst enemies in such a way as to torture them. It degrades us, makes us less than we are when we allow such treatment, encourage it, or apply it personally. There is a fine line between punishing the guilty and becoming what you despise. A guard who tortures one prisoner will be all the more eager to do so again the following day... until it all but completely deprives him/her of humanity.

Does solitary confinement to this extent qualify as torture? In my personal opinion, I think it does. As law defines it though, I'm not sure. Keep in mind though that the longer an individual is held in solitary confinement, the more they deteriorate both physically and psychologically. Anyone with even a very minor grasp of psychology could explain to you how dangerous this is. Perhaps that is the intent though, if the man is declared to be insane and actually does lose his sanity, it would be far easier to leave him in a hospital of some sort for the rest of his life. He could then be quietly forgotten.

Whether we vote D or R will have little impact on this. How we personally treat others, will. How we personally raise our children, what we teach them in regards to right and wrong, will impact generations of the future until this treatment hopefully becomes unthinkable to everyone.

14. I'm an ex-marine, 0341, mortar man, 1985-88

and I feel this one soldier is the best soldier we have ever had. His actions helped bring about the entire Arab Spring and have helped expose nepotism and injustice the world over. Due to him we can possibly hope to one day have a just USA as right now the emperor has no clothes and the truth has been laid bare. "We are the baddies", as Ricky Gervais once said. The world now see's that the ruse of spreading democracy is a just that and nothing more. Our national self interest and desire to work with dictators and murderers for oil, the MIC, and the mighty dollar outweighs our desire to make the world a better place. Bradley helped bring that fact to light. And in the process helped flip 3 corrupt regimes. The US military has taken a decade to attempt to flip two and is only half way there. The one they did flip is now a shia state with a gov't that condones killing homosexuals or people who look gay. Well done America! I think Bradley's a modern Paul Revere. The British aren't coming this time. The MIC is however.

Also, considering what such lengths of solitary confinement can do to the mind... he will be very fortunate indeed to maintain sanity. Far easier to discredit whatever evidence he had if he is determined to be clinically insane.

26. Unfortunately you are right

Another thing the kind of treatment he has been forced to endure will result in a softening up. And I don't blame him but I wouldn't be surprised if because of that, he'll renounce his past beliefs and reasons for doing what he did and beg for forgiveness and mercy. Especially if, away from the cameras, he gets whispers in his ear about all the continued pain and isolation he can look forward to if he doesn't comply.

I think that is what the MIC really wants. A public apology so that the MSM can safely report that all is well and the poor misdirected young man, who was taken advantage of by the evil Wikileaks, has seen the light.

37. Why would the UN cite any evidence Manning may have?

There's still been no determination or evidence presented in a court proceeding that Manning was the source of Wikileaks' information. Manning has just been locked up for months and months, kept in solitary, subjected to torture, and held incommunicado based on little more than the military's embarrassment over what the information published by Wikileaks.

It looks more than a little like the military is making an example out of someone because they can't or won't reach the real culprits or prosecute the war crimes Wikileaks' information details in such damning particulars.

27. Exposing War Crimes is NOT a Crime, READ:

In a nutshell, exposing war crimes is not a crime, it is a duty:

Principles of International Law Recognized in the Charter of the Nüremberg Tribunal and in the Judgment of the Tribunal, 1950.

Principle I

Any person who commits an act which constitutes a crime under international law is responsible therefor and liable to punishment.

Principle II

The fact that internal law does not impose a penalty for an act which constitutes a crime under international law does not relieve the person who committed the act from responsibility under international law.

Principle III

The fact that a person who committed an act which constitutes a crime under international law acted as Head of State or responsible Government official does not relieve him from responsibility under international law.

Principle IV

The fact that a person acted pursuant to order of his Government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law, provided a moral choice was in fact possible to him.

Principle V

Any person charged with a crime under international law has the right to a fair trial on the facts and law.

Principle VI

The crimes hereinafter set out are punishable as crimes under international law:

(a) Crimes against peace:
(i) Planning, preparation, initiation or waging of a war of aggression or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances;
(ii) Participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the acts mentioned under (i).

(b) War crimes:
Violations of the laws or customs of war include, but are not limited to, murder, ill-treatment or deportation to slave-labour or for any other purpose of civilian population of or in occupied territory, murder or ill-treatment of prisoners of war, of persons on the seas, killing of hostages, plunder of public or private property, wanton destruction of cities, towns, or villages, or devastation not justified by military necessity.

(c) Crimes against humanity:
Murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation and other inhuman acts done against any civilian population, or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds, when such acts are done or such persecutions are carried on in execution of or in connexion with any crime against peace or any war crime.

Principle VII

Complicity in the commission of a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity as set forth in Principle VI is a crime under international law.

46. Hmmm...

Say you become a lawyer for a high priced firm. You sign so many contracts that they more or less own you. You go into this firm thinking that they do great work - and to all appearances this is true, their work benefits the greater good, as far as you can tell, they're helping people and making money doing it.

Later you discover that this firm is guilty of bribing government officials to keep silent about a great deal of criminal activity. Murder and theft are the least of what the higher partners are guilty of. Now... you have signed numerous contracts, chances are you also took an oath. Do you keep silent and allow the illegal activity to continue? Or would you report their activities? Attempt to stop them even knowing that legally speaking, they had you by the short hairs. Also, you did, after all, join voluntarily.. would you voluntarily break the rules?

Personally, I like to think that I would, I can't say for certain, but I hope I'd have the courage. A lot of the information that was allegedly leaked by Manning has revealed some very damning things about various world governments.

There are times when it is necessary to break the rules. Do you really think Manning deserves this treatment? Also, I strongly recommend reading post 14, if you haven't already.

What matters is what can be proven, if it can be proven he (manning) broke the law by providing documents marked secret to wikileaks then manning is guilty and all the bs of "but he revealed x info that might have never been revealed" is still bs because if I recall correctly there is a law in place which would have allowed him to report things to the inspector general and or to a member of congress assuming he did provide the data to wikileaks of course.

60. "Dumped" is a good word considering how much nefarious shit

was in the files he allegedly exposed. The "shit" our gov't is up to it's eyeballs in was laid bare for all to see. It looked like a healthy dump to me. I'm curious if you put this much energy into charging the former POTUS when he defiled the military and broke the oath that he swore? After all his actions did lead to the direct deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and undermine the reputation of the United States.

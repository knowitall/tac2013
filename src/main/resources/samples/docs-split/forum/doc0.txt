Rick Santorum told attendees at the Gulf Coast Energy Summit in Biloxi, Mississippi, on Monday to trust his judgment on the environment, highlighting his position on climate changethat is, that it's a liberal myth.

Gingrich, for his part, also took the anti-Obama baton during his speech to the same summit Monday. " very anti-fossil fuel administration," Gingrich said. "The left wing environmental movement hates oil."

19. Unfortunately, no known technology can come anywhere close to replacing the energy demands

55. Indeed, it is essential but ignoring the available technology until/if a feasible alternative

74. Of course...and that may well be our fate. I've also considered the real possibility (no way to

know how realistic it is) that we (!) might essentially run out of fossil hydrocarbons before the resulting CO2 from burning them has irreversibly fouled the atmosphere which might allow
the continuation of animal life, but if anyone has done an analysis on that (including the other carbon sequestration), I haven't seen it - it might be an impossible calculation given all the unknown parameters. <img src="http://www.democraticunderground.com/emoticons/shrug.gif"/>

77. Please don't take this wrong, but environmentalism is in some ways like fundamentalism

it doesn't really work in the real world...what I mean is, damn few people will actually sacrifice access to cheap and convenient energy to prove their 'green' bona fides, like many "TRVE BELIEVERS" are certain that prayer can accomplish anything but they still go to the hospital when they're seriously ill (although some will refuse to send their children...which is another discussion).

78. I take it wrong because you are wrong --Environmentalism does work

It's improved the quality of your water, your air, your environment, while giving you better cars, more efficient energy, more efficient production of products.

Your description of environmentalism is ignorant and wrong.

They did not know about CO2 - really? you must be kidding?

They are able to send missions to Mars but did not know about CO2.

Tell you what, Santorum, what would happen if there were NO CO2 on the planet. You can work you way up to global warming in 3 simple steps.

a) Too little CO2, the planet is cold and uninhabitable.
b) Just enough CO2, the planet is inhabitable.
c) Too much CO2, the planet is too hot and uninhabitable.

It is a little like the three bears. That should be understandable by even a kindergartner.

Then you can come to the conclusion that CO2, besides being used by various living entities in different ways, is like a giant thermostat.

42. You could apply that to all elements in our atmosphere.

I like your example. Like, if we had more oxygen in the atmosphere, people would start acting confused and disoriented. Add a bit more and their skin would start to redden and inflame (right after failure of the cardiac/respiratory system). Oxygen is a flammable, corrosive element. If you added even more, the bombardment of daily meteor and space debris in our atmosphere would probably have fires raging continuously on the planet. Creepy.

A) We will bring alternative energy sources online in greater numbers and use of oil will decline,
OR...
B) We will simply run out of oil

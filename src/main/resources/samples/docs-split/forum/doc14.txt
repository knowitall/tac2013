The Republican fight against health care rights for women may end up hurting the party on election day, according to a new poll.

A Washington Post survey released Monday found that Democrats are perceived as caring more about issues that are important to women by 25 points, 55 percent to 30 percent.

The poll also showed that a large majority of all voters support the idea that businesses should be required to cover the full cost of contraception for female employees. Among all voters, 61 percent supported a mandate for birth control coverage, while 35 percent did not.

Of those who said contraception should be included in insurance coverage at no cost, 79 percent agreed that religious institutions should not be exempted from the mandate. Overall, 3 percent more voters sided with Obama administrations policy requiring religious institutions to include birth control in their insurance plans than those who did not.

16. I think they will come in huge numbers, since their interests are at stake. Efforts should

be made to let more women know what's at stake.

9. well i would imagine, 50% of pop is female right, 30% of that would be 15% of the total pop.

that 15 % plus their husbands they are married to (15 %) would constitute that baseline 28% that we see reoccurring over and over and over.

28% of this nation is bat shit insane. oddly this correlates with the percentage of fundamentalist church goers in this nation.

18. Actually, I understand that it's closer

to 52% of the voting age popuplation that is female.

I remember a quote I read when the birth control issue emerged:

"The Republicans have awakened a sleeping giant, and she is pissed!"

3. This really blew up in the arrogant, misogynistic GOP's bloated face.

I love it!

4. Are we heading toward an Icelandic model of government?

In Iceland, the two main parties are divided not by economics or class, but by gender.

After the recent financial implosion, conceived and executed primarily by men, the women's party won a huge landslide!

19. I don't know if that would work in this country

There's no shortage of outspoken RW women who would rise to prominence - all the while telling women to serve their man &amp; stay at home having babies.

5. Another reason Freepers think the 19th Amendment should be repealed.

So many of them just don't think women should vote. (Or anyone but white, land and gun owning males over the age of 21.)

7. And......

I would guess about one in five women would agree with that.

However, if the Repukes began talking about restricting or banning female drivers, they would lose 100% of the female vote.

11. wouldn't they love it to back to the original constitution.

6. There is 8 months until the election and voters tend to have ADHD on the issues

So I'm hoping that Obama and the democrats remind women who wants to make sure they have the proper healthcare when it comes closer to election time.

12. When people are treated like minorities, they tend to remember

did you know that the major racial and ethnic minorities in this country have become all Democratic in the past decade or so?

21. This issue is real and current.

We must keep it alive. Should the GOP take power next year, they will take what
Walker/Scott/Kasich/Christie/Corbett/Brownback/McDonnell/LePage did on the state level, and do this on the national level.

10. all the republicans need is just a simple asprin

Do you know that a simple aspirin can keep a dumb ass middle aged white republican from saying
something stupid and pissing off over 2/3s of America's women?

Yes, they can just hold it between their lips and not say a f***ing word. Maybe Rep. Issa can hold
some hearings and piss off the last 30%..... although that last 30% are like passengers on the Titanic
who really were thankful for the captain for getting them an extra close view of the iceberg.

20. I keep thinking about that smug little shit Issa

and how he was just so certain his little hearing was going to rally the religious nuts into a wave of anti-Obama furor... Instead he steered the GOP ship into a tsunami of women voters' disdain.

14. That's all?

Only 55% of women polled believe that as a group, Democrats care more about issued that are important to women.

Seriously? It isn't even a matter of which party cares MOST... it is which party is NOT PROACTIVELY WORKING TO HURT women. This shit has been going on for decades.

22. That's what I was thinking also

95% should be the number with a 5% margin of error.

17. Wait to they

find out about the goppers wanting to get between a women and her doctor, i.e., by law/ruling advising the doctor that he/she cannot advise properly about a women pregger's care.

The republican taliban has marginalized the party. Nice work, guys. You let nuts into your party and this is what you get.

26. This will influence a lot of men's votes also. Men want their girl friends, wives, and daughters to

have access to contraception.

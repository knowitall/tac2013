Hi, i'm new to the consortium and would like to ask a few questions.
Firstly this is the first online project i've joined so this is all
new to me. I've been reading some of the posts, and in addition derick
mentioned in his email that your at the stage of trying to get a os/
distro off the ground. Hows it going? What/have you many any decisions
about it yet?

Hi merlinwood, and welcome to the OGC project!

Right now things are going slow, mostly due to real life issues for me
and the fact that we're such a small community. I'm hoping that I can
pick up the pace in October sometime. Right now we haven't made too
many decisions, nothing is set in stone, but the general idea is to
develop a firmware that is capable of running OpenGL/AL and OIS
(Object-oriented Input System). On top of that we'll put something we
call the &quot;HomeUI&quot;, which is essentially a few modules with the same
generic GUI, and we'll develop it in Python.

Hopefully, this will take around six months to complete once I can get
started. We're happy with any help we can get. :)

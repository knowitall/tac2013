 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	3	345	Hello! 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	4	353	I've used GWO in the past with my clients, but I've never tried using it to track affiliate links.  
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	5	453	Meaning, I have a link on my page that goes to a website on another domain. 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	6	529	If someone clicks the link, it should be registered as a conversion event. 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	7	605	I've research this a bit, and found a few posts describing some sort of a solution. 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	8	690	I came upon this code: 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	9	714	&lt;script&gt; if(typeof(urchinTracker)!
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	10	754	='function')document.write('&lt;sc'+'ript src=&quot;'+ 'http'+(document.location.protocol=='https:'?'
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	11	855	s://ssl':'://www')+ '.google-analytics.com/urchin.js'+' &quot;&gt;&lt;/sc'+'ript&gt;') &lt;/script&gt; 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	12	959	&lt;h2 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Click on this link&lt;a href=http:// www.blah.com/payme onclick=&quot;_uacct=' UA-XXXXXXX-X'; urchinTracker('/ XXXXXXXXX/goal'); return true;&quot;&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;!
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	13	1196	&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	14	1222	I can see how it's using an onClick event, but I wasn't sure how that ties into GWO. 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	15	1308	For example, here's the link I want to track &lt;a href=&quot;http:// www.keywordresearching.com/recommends/keycompete &quot; onClick=&quot;javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/ keycompete/');&quot;&gt;KeyCompete&lt;/a&gt; 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	16	1531	I'm already using that link to track onClick events as a Goal for Google Analytics. 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	17	1616	Now I want to tie in GWO. 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	18	1643	Any ideas? 
 eng-NG-31-150399-10636491 	19	1655	Thanks!

 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	4	311	First off, I want to apologize. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	5	343	I've had some trouble with my money flow the last six weeks, and thus I haven't been able to get a stable net connection yet. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	6	469	Also, stuff keeps popping up that require my attention in the real world. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	7	543	So... :/ Hopefully, everything will have settled for good in a month or so, and then I can finally begin to work on the firmware for real. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	8	683	So, since the pace is slowly picking up again, here's a general roll call. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	9	758	Did everyone die, or are there people out there still? 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	10	813	What's happening?

 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	15	1005	Also, it might be a good idea to meet in our MUC to decide how we're going to move forward and see where we are right now, so, meeting time! 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	16	1146	I'm suggesting a weekend in November sometime, anyone against that idea? 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	17	1220	I'm still interested in bringing this to reality, and I hope you guys are. :) Seeya! 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	18	1438	I'm still here too...but just like Wertigon, I keep finding life to get in the way. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636344 	19	1522	This project is taking much longer than I had ever expected, but that's okay.

 eng-NG-31-150304-8805222 	3	309	Hi, i'm new to the consortium and would like to ask a few questions. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805222 	4	378	Firstly this is the first online project i've joined so this is all new to me. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805222 	5	457	I've been reading some of the posts, and in addition derick mentioned in his email that your at the stage of trying to get a os/ distro off the ground. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805222 	6	609	Hows it going? 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805222 	7	624	What/have you many any decisions about it yet? 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805222 	8	787	Hi merlinwood, and welcome to the OGC project! 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805222 	9	835	Right now things are going slow, mostly due to real life issues for me and the fact that we're such a small community. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805222 	10	954	I'm hoping that I can pick up the pace in October sometime. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805222 	11	1014	Right now we haven't made too many decisions, nothing is set in stone, but the general idea is to develop a firmware that is capable of running OpenGL/AL and OIS (Object-oriented Input System). 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805222 	12	1208	On top of that we'll put something we call the &quot;HomeUI&quot;, which is essentially a few modules with the same generic GUI, and we'll develop it in Python. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805222 	13	1370	Hopefully, this will take around six months to complete once I can get started. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805222 	14	1450	We're happy with any help we can get. :)

 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	4	310	First off, I want to apologize. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	5	342	I've had some trouble with my money flow the last six weeks, and thus I haven't been able to get a stable net connection yet. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	6	468	Also, stuff keeps popping up that require my attention in the real world. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	7	542	So... :/ Hopefully, everything will have settled for good in a month or so, and then I can finally begin to work on the firmware for real. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	8	682	So, since the pace is slowly picking up again, here's a general roll call. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	9	757	Did everyone die, or are there people out there still? 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	10	812	What's happening? 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	11	830	If you want to help or think you can help in any way shape or form, please say so. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	12	913	And as for you guys, have you been doing some research and stuff? 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	13	979	Report in, soldiers!

 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	15	1004	Also, it might be a good idea to meet in our MUC to decide how we're going to move forward and see where we are right now, so, meeting time! 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	16	1145	I'm suggesting a weekend in November sometime, anyone against that idea? 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	17	1219	I'm still interested in bringing this to reality, and I hope you guys are. :) Seeya! 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	18	1447	I'm still here too...but just like Wertigon, I keep finding life to get in the way. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	19	1531	This project is taking much longer than I had ever expected, but that's okay. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-8805220 	20	1609	We'll get there eventually as long as we don't give up on this common dream of ours ;)

 eng-NG-31-150304-10636339 	3	302	Hello everyone! 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636339 	4	318	- My name is Joe Herbert and I have been very active in gaming and computer technology sense I was very young. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636339 	5	429	I have graduated WarenTech (jefferson county vocational school) with a certification in Computer Programming and Technology and have worked as a professional QA Tech (tester) on several Activision game projects (still under NDA). 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636339 	6	659	Several years ago a friend and I had begun taking notes and writing up plans for just such a project! 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636339 	7	761	We unfortunately allowed ourselves to get destracted. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636339 	8	815	We did not think we were ready for a project proposal. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636339 	9	870	I was amazed when I learned that we were not the only ones to think of an open gaming platform. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636339 	10	966	I would like to do what i can to help this project get going and would love to share some of the ideas that i had come upwith, aswell as some of the issues (that i have not seen addressed on the wiki) that i had faced when trying to come up with my own plans for an OGC.

 eng-NG-31-150304-10636346 	3	310	Hi, i'm new to the consortium and would like to ask a few questions. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636346 	4	379	Firstly this is the first online project i've joined so this is all new to me. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636346 	5	458	I've been reading some of the posts, and in addition derick mentioned in his email that your at the stage of trying to get a os/ distro off the ground. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636346 	6	610	Hows it going? 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636346 	7	625	What/have you many any decisions about it yet? 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636346 	8	788	Hi merlinwood, and welcome to the OGC project! 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636346 	9	836	Right now things are going slow, mostly due to real life issues for me and the fact that we're such a small community. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636346 	10	955	I'm hoping that I can pick up the pace in October sometime. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636346 	11	1015	Right now we haven't made too many decisions, nothing is set in stone, but the general idea is to develop a firmware that is capable of running OpenGL/AL and OIS (Object-oriented Input System). 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636346 	12	1209	On top of that we'll put something we call the &quot;HomeUI&quot;, which is essentially a few modules with the same generic GUI, and we'll develop it in Python. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636346 	13	1371	Hopefully, this will take around six months to complete once I can get started. 
 eng-NG-31-150304-10636346 	14	1451	We're happy with any help we can get. :)

 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	3	321	David, 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	4	329	I just read your post on embedding rdf in xhtml.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	5	379	I like where you're going, but I'm skeptical about embedding rdf with xhtml.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	6	457	Microformats seem to scratch an itch for designers, and designers tend to have the power to get them released on their site. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	7	583	When the source is a backend that's already capable of creating rdf formatted data, I'd imagine a discoverable link within the xhtml would be better...something similar to auto discovered RSS, operator would recognize a div/span and be redirected to the end point that provides RDF. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	8	867	The problem with OWL/RDF is that it isn't well specified for common domains.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	9	945	Take for example the ical ontology posted on the w3c.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	10	1000	Load that up into Protege and it doesn't even recognize the date fields as dates, they aren't specified as 'functional' and allow multiple entries...you cannot have an event start at two times.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	11	1195	It's just a really poor example of owl, and yet, that's supposed to be the OWL version of vCalendar.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	12	1297	The microformat standard is better.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	13	1334	Go ahead, load this up in Protege http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal/ical .  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	14	1406	Even if we want to share our data, it's not clear what ontology we should use! 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	15	1486	At the spring semweb conference in San Jose somebody gave a talk on embedding rdf in Atom...at first I thought that it was an odd idea, but he's right, it's a really good idea.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	16	1664	Google is using Atom for it's open social.  
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	17	1708	So the XHTML would frame a region and point the plugin to the rdf endpoint, and it'd probably be best to deliver it via Atom...which I think would allow the rdf to be more normal, regular rdf, as opposed to RDFa. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	18	2055	My (small) dissappointment in Microformats is really that they force you to use a kind of pre-defined structure (basically templates) to make the data machine-readable. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	19	2224	That's fine when we are talking about vCards, or address specifications, but what if I wish to to do same for food, or movies, books or other topics. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	20	2374	You'd need a microformat specification for each one of them. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	21	2435	A common syntax to express ontological data would allow us to overcome these limitations, as you can somehow separate meaning versus representation. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	22	2584	I do agree OWL has it's limitations (for one that has been addressed by OWL 1.1; cfr an earlier post of mine: http://lists.tdwg.org/pipermail/tdwg-tag/2006-September/000171.html ), but currently I know of no other ontology language that has (being xml / RDF based) to possibility to integrate with web content. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	23	2895	One thing I am thinking of is that you could markup sections of text with reference to an ontology class they are referring to, and more or less forget about advanced relating. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	24	3072	Very Rudimentary example: &lt;div instanceof=&quot;someontology#address&quot;&gt; &lt;span instanceof=&quot;someontology#street&quot;&gt;some street&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span instanceof=&quot;someontology#country&quot;&gt;France&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; By reasoning over the tagged classes the relations could be extracted by itself and a template might be generated. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	25	3437	I must agree this thought is quite primitive at the moment, and yes, there still should be a reference ontology to which you refer (although if you abstract it you might try and let go explicit ontology references in the above examples (instanceof=&quot;street&quot;, instanceof=&quot;country&quot; etc) and let an application that works with the data disambiguate the meaning of it. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	26	3821	All very hypothetical of course. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	27	3855	In the case of the ical example, I believe it would be better if the rdf:datatype would be made explicit as xsd:date-time (instead of integer as it is now), and if I am correct the property should be declared as datatypeproperty as well. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	28	4093	So there might be some design imperfections, and perhaps correcting these might lead to a better recognition in Protege. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	29	4214	It just shows that OWL is not very accessible to many (and also got me puzzled now and then) and is really still in it's infancy. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	30	4345	Perhaps putting RDF into Atom feeds would allow you to achieve certain things, but in my opinion the direct tagging of content with semantic classes, although very impractical, might definately have some advantages as well. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	31	4570	I wrote the article (in the same way that I use the website) to try and explore some ideas I have, whether embedding OWL in XHTML will or will not be a mainstream, the fact that it is possible already got me (and I hope others) thinking, and we all know the semantic web requires a serious push in the back.

 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	51	6848	i have been thinking for some time about a use case where i use rdfa to mark up extensive web-based lectures for students. this would require creating an ontology for the course topic which may at first be problematic but may well be adopted by publishers if successful. this would allow reasoning and relationships between the lecture, the course discussions, assessments such as carefully structured multiple guess, and other course elements. your article is very interesting to me with reference to this project. these kinds of applications of rdfa are not directly related to data exchange (at least at first), but allow the semantic web to be used to create content and then actually use that content outside the web page. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	52	7710	That is exactly the kind of use-case I'm having in mind as well. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	53	7775	And true, it would require an ontology about your domain of discourse first. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	54	7852	On top of that particular usecase of RDfa, having the ontology content easily accessible (and hence, easily referencable) would promote the use of it, which in my opinion provides arguments for publishing the ontology within regular web pages as well. 
 eng-NG-31-150372-10636473 	55	8104	Publishing the ontology within web pages would could also make it more transparant to the user and thereby let him understand the content better, that is something you will never achieve by just looking at the OWL syntax (or any other syntax you express your ontology in), which by definition facilitates machine-readability, not human understanding....

 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	2	158	Fun Easy and ONLY 5 dollars? 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	3	320	MAKE QUICK LEGAL EASY MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	4	369	&quot; Turn $5.00 into $42,000, WITH HARDLY ANY WORK.... read this to find out how!!!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	5	456	READING THIS COULD CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	6	496	I found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	7	552	A little while back, I was browsing through newsgroups, just like you are now, and came across an article similar to this that said you could make thousands of cash within weeks with only an initial investment of $5.00!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	8	773	So I thought, &quot;Yeah right, this must  be a scam&quot;, but like most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	9	888	Before you get skeptical, just take a few minutes to fishish reading this. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	10	963	WITH THIS PLAN, YOU REALLY CAN MAKE TONS OF TOTALLY LEGAL, FAST AND EASY CASH MONEY!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	11	1049	IT WORKS!!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	12	1061	BUT YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW IT CAREFULLY FOR IT TO WORK CORRECTLY AND IN YOUR FAVOR!!!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	13	1144	WITH ALL THE MONEY YOU ARE GONNA MAKE, YOU WILL SOON GET EVERTHING YOU'VE  ALWAYS DREAMED OF!!!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	14	1241	Here's how it works. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	15	1262	All you do is send $1.00 to each of the 5 names and address stated in the article. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	16	1345	You then place your own name and address in the bottom of the list at #5, and post the article in at least 200 newsgroups. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	17	1468	(There are thousands.) 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	18	1491	No catch, that was it. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	19	1514	So after thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about trying it. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	20	1603	I figured, what have I got to lose except 5 stamps and $5.00, right? 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	21	1672	Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	22	1769	So I checked it out with the U.S. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	23	1803	Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	24	1876	Then I invested the measly $5.00. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	25	1910	Well, GUESS WHAT!!... 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	26	1932	Within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	27	1984	I was shocked! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	28	1999	I figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	29	2063	In my first week, I made about $25.00. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	30	2102	By the end of the second week I had made a total of over $1,000! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	31	2167	In the third week I had over $10,000 and it's still growing. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	32	2228	This is now my fourth week and I have made a total of just over $42,000.00, and it's still coming in rapidly. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	33	2338	It's certainly worth $5.00, and 5 stamps. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	34	2380	By the way, I have spent more than that on the lottery in the last month!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	35	2455	Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, why it works....also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so you can get the information off of it as you  need it. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	36	2637	STEP 1: Get 5 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of paper, &quot;PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST.
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	37	2765	&quot; Also, be sure to include your name and address. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	38	2820	Now, get 5 U.S. $1.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH of the 5 pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the envelope, to prevent thievery. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	39	2971	Next, place one paper in each of the 5 envelopes and seal them. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	40	3035	You should now have 5 sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, your name and address, and a $1.00 bill. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	41	3169	What you are doing is creating a service by this. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	42	3219	THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	43	3245	Mail the 5 envelopes to the following addresses: 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	44	3295	:#1) CINDY  MCCLANAHAN 7656  SOMERSET LN.

 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	51	3530	#5) ANGELA  ROCKWELL P.O.BOX 146 FRANKFORT, ME  04438 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	52	3585	STEP 2:   Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the other names up (5 becomes 4, 4 becomes 3, etc...) and add YOUR Name as number 5 on the list. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	53	3751	STEP 3:   Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article as close to original as possible. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	54	3853	If you do not live in the U.S. or there is a foreign address, you must put an international stamp on your envelopes. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	55	3970	Now, post your amended article to at least 200 newsgroups. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	56	4029	(I think there are close to 24,000 groups in all.) 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	57	4080	All you need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the more money you make! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	58	4160	: -----DIRECTIONS FOR HOW TO POST TO ON NEWSGROUP BULLETINS----- STEP 1: You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your own posting.

 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	73	5432	All you have to do is jump to different newsgroups and post away. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	74	5498	After you get the hang of it, it will only take about 30 seconds for each posting!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	75	5582	**REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE!!
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	76	5657	---BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200** That's it! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	77	5711	You will begin receiving money from around the world within days! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	78	5777	You may eventually want to rent a P.O. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	79	5816	Box due to the large amount of mail you will receive. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	80	5870	If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a name to use, as long as the postal service will deliver it. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	81	5978	**JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT** ----Now the WHY part---- Out of 200 postings, say I receive only 5 replies (a very low example). 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	82	6124	So then I made $5.00 with my name at #5 on the letter. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	83	6179	Now, each of the 5 persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each with my name at #5, and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5, that is another $25.00. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	84	6363	Then those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts with my name at #4, and only 5 replies to each, and I will bring in an additional $125.00! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	85	6496	Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at #3 and only receive 5 replies each, and I will make an additional $625.00! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	86	6647	OK, now here is the fun part. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	87	6677	Each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM 200 letters with my name at #2, and they each only receive 5 replies, that just made me $3,125.00!!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	88	6819	Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this message to 200 newsgroups with my name at #1, and if still 5 persons per 200 newsgroups react, I will receive an amazing $15,625,00! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	89	6994	With an original investment of only $5.00! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	90	7037	AMAZING! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	91	7046	When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send out another $5.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 5 again. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	92	7225	Then start posting again. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	93	7251	That's it! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	94	7262	Do you realize that thousands of honest people just like you all over the world are joining the internet and reading these articles everyday? 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	95	7404	So can you afford $5.00 and see if it really works?? 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	96	7457	I think so... 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	97	7471	People have said, &quot;what if the plan is played out and no one sends you the money? 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	98	7558	So what! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	99	7567	What are the chances of that happening when there are tons of new honest users who are  joining the internet and newsgroups everyday. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	100	7701	So, are willing to give it a try? 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	101	7735	Estimates are about 20,000 to 50,000 new bulletin board users every day, with thousands of those joining the internet  itself. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	102	7862	Remember, please play FAIRLY! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	103	7892	This ensures a huge circle of wealth that grows with the internet audience!!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	104	7970	Everyone benefits!!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	105	7991	Remember to send the FIVE envelopes to the above addresses, in order to create the legal service. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	106	8089	At first I was to scared to try this, but once I researched it, I found that it is totally legal. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	107	8187	When you send the FIVE envelopes out, you create a service, a legal service. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	108	8264	The Internet audience is expanding all the time. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-8805227 	109	8313	The audience is like an equity stock on the stock market, continuously going up.

 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	13	1145	WITH ALL THE MONEY YOU ARE GONNA MAKE, YOU WILL SOON GET EVERTHING YOU'VE  ALWAYS DREAMED OF!!!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	14	1242	Here's how it works. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	15	1263	All you do is send $1.00 to each of the 5 names and address stated in the article. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	16	1346	You then place your own name and address in the bottom of the list at #5, and post the article in at least 200 newsgroups. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	17	1469	(There are thousands.) 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	18	1492	No catch, that was it. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	19	1515	So after thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about trying it. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	20	1604	I figured, what have I got to lose except 5 stamps and $5.00, right? 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	21	1673	Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	22	1770	So I checked it out with the U.S. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	23	1804	Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	24	1877	Then I invested the measly $5.00. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	25	1911	Well, GUESS WHAT!!... 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	26	1933	Within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	27	1985	I was shocked! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	28	2000	I figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	29	2064	In my first week, I made about $25.00. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	30	2103	By the end of the second week I had made a total of over $1,000! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	31	2168	In the third week I had over $10,000 and it's still growing. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	32	2229	This is now my fourth week and I have made a total of just over $42,000.00, and it's still coming in rapidly. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	33	2339	It's certainly worth $5.00, and 5 stamps. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	34	2381	By the way, I have spent more than that on the lottery in the last month!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	35	2456	Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, why it works....also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so you can get the information off of it as you  need it. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	36	2638	STEP 1: Get 5 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of paper, &quot;PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST.
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	37	2766	&quot; Also, be sure to include your name and address. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	38	2821	Now, get 5 U.S. $1.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH of the 5 pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the envelope, to prevent thievery. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	39	2972	Next, place one paper in each of the 5 envelopes and seal them. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	40	3036	You should now have 5 sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, your name and address, and a $1.00 bill. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	41	3170	What you are doing is creating a service by this. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	42	3220	THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	43	3246	Mail the 5 envelopes to the following addresses: 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	44	3296	:#1) CINDY  MCCLANAHAN 7656  SOMERSET LN.

 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	55	3971	Now, post your amended article to at least 200 newsgroups. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	56	4030	(I think there are close to 24,000 groups in all.) 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	57	4081	All you need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the more money you make!

 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	75	5583	**REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE!!
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	76	5658	---BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200** That's it!

 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	78	5778	You may eventually want to rent a P.O. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	79	5817	Box due to the large amount of mail you will receive. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	80	5871	If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a name to use, as long as the postal service will deliver it. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	81	5979	**JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT** ----Now the WHY part---- Out of 200 postings, say I receive only 5 replies (a very low example). 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	82	6125	So then I made $5.00 with my name at #5 on the letter. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	83	6180	Now, each of the 5 persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each with my name at #5, and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5, that is another $25.00. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	84	6364	Then those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts with my name at #4, and only 5 replies to each, and I will bring in an additional $125.00! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	85	6497	Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at #3 and only receive 5 replies each, and I will make an additional $625.00! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	86	6648	OK, now here is the fun part. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	87	6678	Each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM 200 letters with my name at #2, and they each only receive 5 replies, that just made me $3,125.00!!! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	88	6820	Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this message to 200 newsgroups with my name at #1, and if still 5 persons per 200 newsgroups react, I will receive an amazing $15,625,00! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	89	6995	With an original investment of only $5.00! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	90	7038	AMAZING! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	91	7047	When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send out another $5.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 5 again. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	92	7226	Then start posting again. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	93	7252	That's it! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	94	7263	Do you realize that thousands of honest people just like you all over the world are joining the internet and reading these articles everyday? 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	95	7405	So can you afford $5.00 and see if it really works?? 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	96	7458	I think so... 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	97	7472	People have said, &quot;what if the plan is played out and no one sends you the money? 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	98	7559	So what! 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	99	7568	What are the chances of that happening when there are tons of new honest users who are  joining the internet and newsgroups everyday. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	100	7702	So, are willing to give it a try? 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	101	7736	Estimates are about 20,000 to 50,000 new bulletin board users every day, with thousands of those joining the internet  itself.

 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	105	7992	Remember to send the FIVE envelopes to the above addresses, in order to create the legal service. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	106	8090	At first I was to scared to try this, but once I researched it, I found that it is totally legal. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	107	8188	When you send the FIVE envelopes out, you create a service, a legal service. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	108	8265	The Internet audience is expanding all the time. 
 eng-NG-31-150373-10636474 	109	8314	The audience is like an equity stock on the stock market, continuously going up.

Chile swine flu cases jump to 276
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Santiago, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chilean health authorities confirmed 26 new cases of swine flu on Sunday,
raising the number of patients with A(H1N1) virus in the country to 276, the
highest number on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The sometimes-deadly disease continued its rise across Latin America meanwhile
with Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru and the Dominican Republic all reporting
new cases.
</P>
<P>
Officials here said that most of the victims were in the capital, and that most
cases were mild and being treated at home. Three people remain in serious
condition in hospital, however.
</P>
<P>
Swine flu has killed nearly a hundred and infected over 15,500 worldwide,
according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, since it emerged in North
America in late April.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by individual governments, the virus has actually
now killed more than 110 people around the world.
</P>
<P>
In the southern hemisphere, health experts fear the new virus could take hold,
as winter sets in and the regular flu season gets underway.
</P>
<P>
Argentine health authorities meanwhile reported 15 new cases on Sunday, a day
after reporting 20 new cases, raising the country's total patient count to 115.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Buenos Aires said those with new swine flu infections were
recovering well and that most of them were found at several private schools in
the capital, where students had recently returned from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak has prompted officials to close the schools for two weeks in a bid
to contain the virus.
</P>
<P>
In the Dominican Republic officials confirmed nine cases of the disease, raising
the country's total to 11, a day after Santo Domingo rebuffed a Russian claim
that the Caribbean island was underreporting its cases in a bid to boost
tourism.
</P>
<P>
"We fear that in reality, the situation is very different," Gennady Onishchenko,
Russia's chief sanitary inspector, had told the Interfax news agency in response
to the island reporting only two cases.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday the island's Ministry of Public Health reported that of the nine new
cases one had been hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
In Peru health authorities said they had confirmed two more cases of the virus,
bringing the country's total to 40.
</P>
<P>
Both cases were found in Lima and are recovering well on medication at home,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Brazil also confirmed four new cases, which brought the country's total number
to 20.
</P>
<P>
At its last count at the end of last week Mexican authorities said 97 people had
died from the disease and that 4,932 had been infected. Officials however
maintained that the epidemic was on the wane there.

Basketball: Despite sting of defeat, James says Cavs on right track
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CLEVELAND, Ohio, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player LeBron James insisted
Sunday that Cleveland were on the right track, despite their painful failure to
reach the NBA finals.
</P>
<P>
James couldn't bring himself to address the media or congratulate the players of
the Orlando Magic on Saturday night, after the Magic defeated the Cavs in game
six of the Eastern Conference finals to reach the league's championship series.
</P>
<P>
But as he and teammates gathered for the last team meeting of the season here on
Sunday, James tried to put a positive spin on the Cavaliers season.
</P>
<P>
Cleveland notched the best record in the regular season with 66 victories, won
their division and swept to victory in four games in each of their first two
playoff series.
</P>
<P>
Then they ran into the surprising Magic, who had already ousted reigning
champions Boston in seven games, and even "King" James's heroics couldn't save
them.
</P>
<P>
"You want to continue to get better, that's all you can ask," said James, whose
team lost to Boston in the conference finals last year.
</P>
<P>
"We got better this season and I feel this team will be better next season. You
don't want to take a step backward. I thought we went forward from the Boston
series to this year and hopefully we can go forward one more time next year."
</P>
<P>
James certainly did all he could to take his team one step further.
</P>
<P>
His buzzer-beating 3-pointer saved Cleveland in game two against Orlando. He had
21 points, 17 in the second half, in game five, a contest that saw him finish
with 37 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists.
</P>
<P>
Now the big question exercising Cleveland - the club's management, his teammates
and Cavs fans - is how this defeat will influence his future with the team.
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers can offer him a contract extension in July. He can extend the
contract up to four years, or play out his current contract that ends after next
season and make a move via free agency. He could also exercise a player option
for the 2010-11 season.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't thought about it just yet," James said. "I'm just going to take time
off from basketball and not think about contracts or the game, period, and relax
with my family."
</P>
<P>
James defended his actions in Orlando on Saturday, when he strode off the court
- to a smattering of taunts from Magic fans - without congratulating his
opponents.
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't have much to say," said James, who said he had since e-mailed
Orlando star Dwight Howard. "One thing about me you've got to understand - it is
hard for me to congratulate somebody after just losing to him.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a winner. That's not being a poor sport or anything like that. If somebody
beats you up, you are not going to congratulate them (for) beating you up. That
doesn't make sense to me."

Business says British politicians distracted by expenses row
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, June 1, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The row over MPs' expenses is distracting Britain's politicians from confronting
the serious economic issues facing the country, a prominent business leader said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Richard Lambert, director-general of the CBI, told the Financial Times that all
the main parties should be focusing on their plans to deal with the recession
ahead of European and local elections later this week.
</P>
<P>
"I've just been talking to business people in Brussels and the sense of
bewilderment about what's happening and what it means for the UK and Europe is
palpable," Lambert told the FT.
</P>
<P>
"We've got important elections and they are being completely overshadowed by
these disclosures."
</P>
<P>
He added: "Clearly there's an enormous, understandable public outrage... but
we've got big decisions to be taken by all the big political parties about the
future shape and role of the state, and these have been completely brushed to
one side."
</P>
<P>
Polls over the weekend suggested British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Labour
party is in danger of coming third in the elections for the European Parliament
on Thursday, largely because of disillusionment over the expenses row.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Conservatives have also suffered from the scandal and
analysts expect fringe parties such as the anti-EU UK Independence Party (Ukip)
and the far-right British National Party to benefit.
</P>
<P>
Brown insisted Sunday that he was focused on the recession, brushing aside calls
for him to quit in favour of a more popular leader and saying: "I am dealing
with the economy every day."
</P>
<P>
In an article in the Daily Mirror, he also launched a strong attack on the BNP,
describing them as a "nasty extreme party" made up of "Nazi thugs" and urging
voters not to back them when they go to the polls this week.

Golf: Stricker claims Colonial crown at second hole of sudden death
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
FORT WORTH, Texas, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Stricker birdied the second playoff hole to win the 6.2 million-dollar
Colonial on Sunday, leaving South African Tim Clark still in search of his first
USPGA tour title.
</P>
<P>
Stricker defeated Clark and Steve Marino in the playoff to claim his first title
of 2009 to go with his runner-up, third-place, fourth-place, sixth- and seventh-
place finishes this year.
</P>
<P>
For Clark it was yet another near miss. His 12.7 million dollars in US earnings
are the most of any player without a victory in PGA Tour history.
</P>
<P>
He squandered a two-shot lead with five holes left, including a bogey on the
72nd hole that forced the playoff.
</P>
<P>
He also missed a putt that would have given him the victory at the first playoff
hole.
</P>
<P>
On the second, Stricker stuck his approach within a few feet and Clark almost
followed suit.
</P>
<P>
But Clark's hit the stick and rolled more than 20 feet away. The South African
missed his birdie attempt and Stricker made his for a fifth career crown.
</P>
<P>
Clark, meanwhile, settled for a seventh second-place finish, including at this
tournament behind Phil Mickelson last year.
</P>
<P>
Clark, who started the day with a two-stroke lead, carded a 70 to finish
regulation on 263. Stricker and Marino both shot 68 to join him in the playoff.
</P>
<P>
Australian Jason Day carded a 69 to finish alone in fourth on 264, one shot in
front of England's Paul Casey.

2,000 to leave Australian flu ship after all-clear: officials
</HEADLINE>

Sydney, June 1, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 2,000 passengers were given the all-clear to leave the Pacific Dawn cruise
ship here on Monday after Australian officials found none was carrying swine
flu.
</P>
<P>
The ship has been at the centre of an outcry after infected passengers were
allowed to disembark last week, prompting an explosion in Australia's swine flu
cases.
</P>
<P>
"No evidence of any additional cases of human swine influenza has been found on
board the Pacific Dawn, and most importantly, there has been no person-to-person
transmission on board the ship," New South Wales' top health official, Kerry
Chant, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Three crew members who caught the disease have now recovered and remain in
quarantine, P&amp;O Cruises said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Infected passengers were among 2,000 who disembarked here last Monday following
an earlier cruise on the ship. Australia's swine flu cases, then fewer than 20,
had shot up to 303 by Sunday.

Britain's Prince Harry admits finding army training tough
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, June 1, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Britain's Prince Harry admitted Monday that he sometimes questions whether he
will succeed in his army training -- but said his brother Prince William helps
take the pressure off by cooking for him.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old, the youngest son of Prince Charles and the late princess Diana,
is currently training to be a pilot with the Army Air Corps.
</P>
<P>
Based at RAF Shawbury in the West Midlands, he lives with William, who is
training to become a search and rescue pilot with the Royal Air Force (RAF).
</P>
<P>
"We hardly ever see each other. And now we are living together and it's
fantastic," Harry said in a syndicated interview.
</P>
<P>
"(William) does most of the cooking. I spend time just lying around, watching TV
and doing my work," he said, and joked: "The RAF don't have to work as hard as
the army."
</P>
<P>
William is reportedly giving his brother advice ahead of his first helicopter
flight in the coming weeks, and Harry admitted that he had found the training
difficult.
</P>
<P>
"The flying courses are so intense," he said, adding: "It's surprised me."
</P>
<P>
He said: "There's times when I thought, you know, I'm really not cut out for
this, mentally. I hope I've got the physical skills to fly a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
"But mentally, there are the exams and everything. I mean, I can't do maths, I
gave that up when I left school, as anyone does at that age. But I've been
throwing myself back in the deep end."
</P>
<P>
Harry has recently returned from a two-day visit to New York, which he described
as a "nice break" from the training. It was his first trip abroad as official
representative of Buckingham Palace.

Football: Perez to take reins at Real Madrid again
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MADRID, June 1, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spanish construction magnate Florentino Perez will be sworn in as president of
Real Madrid again later on Monday as no other candidate stood against him before
the deadline, the club said.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old will be sworn in at the Real's Santiago Bernabeu stadium at 1 pm
(1100 GMT), the club said in a statement posted on its website shortly after the
deadline of midnight (2200 GMT) on Sunday had expired.
</P>
<P>
Several challengers who had been expected to oppose him pulled out or were not
able to lodge a bank guarantee of 57.4 million euros (81.1 million dollars)
required by the club to be able to run for president.
</P>
<P>
Perez last led Real, Spain's historically most successful team and the world's
richest football club by revenues, from 2000 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
Under his rein Real earned the nickname "Los Galacticos", winning the Primera
Liga twice and the European Champions League with such stars as Zinedine Zidane,
Ronaldo, Luis Figo and David Beckham.
</P>
<P>
He officially presented his candidacy on Thursday under the slogan "the dream is
back" and said the team he would help build would be world beaters.
</P>
<P>
"We will build a spectacular team with top notch players. We have set up a
strong and stable sporting project which will be able to call upon footballers
who will turn each Real Madrid match into a fascinating rendez-vous," he said.
</P>
<P>
Perez has not mentioned any names regarding top signings but Spanish media has
reported that Chilean Manuel Pellegrini, currently at Villarreal, would become
coach in place of Juande Ramos and the club would also land AC Milan's Brazilian
playmaker Kaka.
</P>
<P>
Media reports also constantly speculate that Cristiano Ronaldo, Liverpool's
Spanish star Xabi Alonso and Bayern Munich's French star Franck Ribery will don
the all-white strip next term.
</P>
<P>
Real has been led on an interim basis by Vicente Boluda, who took the reins of
the club after Ramon Calderon stepped down in January following allegations that
he rigged voting at the club's last annual general assembly in December.
</P>
<P>
Had another candidate stood against Perez, elections for president -- normally
held every four years -- would have taken place on June 14.
</P>
<P>
Real's arch-rivals Barcelona won the Champions League, the Spanish title and the
Spanish Cup this season under debutante coach Pep Guardiola.
</P>
<P>
But in an interview published Sunday in daily newspaper El Pais, Perez said
Barcelona's success this season "motivates me even more".
</P>
<P>
"I do not place any limit on myself," he told the newspaper, adding the club
"needs a revolution".
</P>
<P>
Real ended the season on Sunday with a 2-1 loss to lowly Osasuna.

Football: FIFA 'in compliance' with world anti-doping code - Blatter
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NASSAU, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
World football's governing body has been notified that its policies are "totally
in compliance" with those of the World Anti-Doping Agency, apart from the issue
of reintegrating players after a suspension, FIFA president Joseph Blatter said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Blatter, speaking at the conclusion of FIFA executive committee meetings here,
said WADA had confirmed that "FIFA's disciplinary code and FIFA's anti-doping
code, is totally in compliance with the WADA code".
</P>
<P>
The lone exception, he said had to do with when suspended players can resume
training with their clubs.
</P>
<P>
FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke said that FIFA's position is that a player
suspended for 12 months should be allowed to resume training after nine months.
</P>
<P>
FIFA and WADA had been at odds recently over WADA requirements on availablity of
players for out-of-competition drugs testing.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of January, the world anti-doping code requires elite
athletes to give notice of their location at a chosen one-hour period each day,
seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
FIFA had contended that players should be subject to testing when with their
teams, but not when on holiday.
</P>
<P>
World anti-doping chief John Fahey said FIFA's stance "ignores the reality of
doping in sport."
</P>
<P>
"There is no problem between the WADA organization and FIFA," Blatter said.
</P>
<P>
"The only problem that we had, which has now been put away ... is the question,
'Is WADA a service organization for the world of sport?' The answer is yes. WADA
is not a police organization."

Abortion doctor shot dead in Kansas church
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WICHITA, Kansas, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities here on Sunday arrested a suspect in the death of a controversial
provider of late-term abortions, who was fatally shot as he walked into services
at his Kansas church, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Abortion doctor George Tiller was shot to death just after 10:00 am (1500 GMT)
in the lobby of Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kansas, police and city
officials said.
</P>
<P>
President Barack Obama expressed outrage at the fatal shooting of the
controversial doctor, in a statement released by the White House.
</P>
<P>
"I am shocked and outraged by the murder of Dr George Tiller as he attended
church services this morning," said Obama.
</P>
<P>
"However profound our differences as Americans over difficult issues such as
abortion, they cannot be resolved by heinous acts of violence."
</P>
<P>
Wichita officials said the suspect, who was not identified, was arrested some
three hours after the killing. Local media identified the suspect as a 51-year-
old man, who would be returned to Wichita to be charged.
</P>
<P>
"It's an unfortunate incident to happen on a Sunday morning," Wichita police
captain Brent Allred told reporters. "These things should not occur at a any
time."
</P>
<P>
Long a lightning rod in the bitter US culture war over abortion, Tiller, 67,
over the years had been picketed, bombed and shot in the arms, before being
killed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tiller's was one of only three clinics in the United States that perform late-
term abortions, which are performed on fetuses that would be viable outside the
mother's womb.
</P>
<P>
Late-term abortions are legal in Kansas if two independent physicians agree that
the mother could suffer irreparable harm by giving birth.
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred just two weeks after Obama sought "common ground" over the
divisive abortion debate in a controversial speech at one of the top Catholic
universities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
President Obama has attempted to defuse one of the most emotive issues in US
public life by arguing that while abortion should remain legal, the government
should do all it can to limit unwanted pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
But Obama has angered the anti-abortion movement by reversing predecessor George
W. Bush's restrictions on federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research and
for family-planning groups that carry out or facilitate abortions overseas.
</P>
<P>
Obama's choice for health secretary, former Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius,
has been widely condemned by the anti-abortion movement because of her ties to
Tiller.
</P>
<P>
His family released a statement saying Tiller "dedicated his life to providing
women with high-quality heath care despite frequent threats and violence,"
according to the local KWCH TV station.
</P>
<P>
"We ask that he be remembered as a good husband, father and grandfather and a
dedicated servant on behalf of the rights of women everywhere."
</P>
<P>
Tiller had been demonized by abortion opponents who regularly protested outside
his clinic.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, someone placed a bomb on the roof of the clinic, seriously damaging the
building. In 1993, Tiller was shot in both arms outside the clinic. Tiller
recovered, and his assailant received an 11-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 protesters were also arrested outside the clinic during summer-long
demonstrations in 1991.
</P>

He was acquitted in March on charges that he performed 19 illegal abortions in
2003 in a case which his lawyer described as a witch hunt.

Tiller testified during the trial that he spent years under the protection of

Football: Perez returns to presidency of Real Madrid - club

MADRID, June 1, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Florentino Perez will be sworn in once again as president of Real Madrid on
Monday since no other candidate stood against him before the deadline for
applications passed, the club said.
</P>
<P>
"The new president of Real Madrid, Florentino Perez, will be sworn in on
Monday," the club said in a statement posted on its website after the deadline
of midnight (2200 GMT) on Sunday had expired.
</P>
<P>
Several challengers who had been expected to oppose the 62-year-old construction
magnate pulled out or were not able to lodge a bank guarantee of 57.4 million
euros (81.1 million dollars) with the club required to be able to run for
president.
</P>
<P>
Perez last led Real, Spain's historically most successful team, from 2000 to
2006.
</P>
<P>
Under his rein Real earned the nickname "Los Galacticos", winning the Primera
Liga twice and the European Champions League with such stars as Zinedine Zidane,
Ronaldo, Luis Figo and David Beckham.
</P>
<P>
Real has been led on an interim basis by Vicente Boluda, who took the reins of
the club after Ramon Calderon stepped down in January following allegations that
he rigged voting at the club's last annual general assembly in December.
</P>
<P>
Had another candidate stood against Perez, elections for president -- normally
held every four years -- would have taken place on June 14.
</P>
<P>
Real's arch-rivals Barcelona won the Champions League, the Spanish title and the
Spanish Cup this season under debutante coach Pep Guardiola.

President Barack Obama expressed outrage on Sunday at the fatal shooting of a
controversial Kansas doctor who performed late-term abortions, in a statement
released by the White House.
</P>
<P>
"I am shocked and outraged by the murder of Dr George Tiller as he attended
church services this morning," said Obama.
</P>
<P>
"However profound our differences as Americans over difficult issues such as
abortion, they cannot be resolved by heinous acts of violence."
</P>
<P>
Tiller was shot to death just after 10:00 am (1500 GMT) in the lobby of
Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kansas. A suspect was arrested three
hours later, police said.
</P>
<P>
Over the years Tiller had been picketed, bombed and shot in both of his arms by
anti-abortion protesters.
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred just two weeks after Obama sought "common ground" over the
divisive abortion debate in a controversial speech at one of the top Catholic
universities in the United States.

US seeks slower Lat Am rapprochement with Cuba
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
San Salvador, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton began a visit to Central America Sunday, amid
new US steps toward ties with Cuba that Washington hopes will slow a sudden
regional push to end Havana's isolation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton landed in San Salvador from Washington where a senior State Department
official announced that Cuba had agreed to resume talks with the United States
on migration and direct mail service.
</P>
<P>
The chief US diplomat is in El Salvador for Monday's inauguration of president-
elect Mauricio Funes before traveling to neighboring Honduras for Tuesday's
general assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS).
</P>
<P>
The OAS is beset by a row over the pace of normalization with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
President Barack Obama's administration insists Cuba release political prisoners
and improve political freedoms before it is readmitted to the 35-member
organization. Some OAS states however want Cuba readmitted right away.
</P>
<P>
A senior US official, who is traveling with Clinton, told reporters that Havana
informed Washington on Saturday that it will take up the US offer to resume
long-stalled talks on migration issues and on direct mail service.
</P>
<P>
"We and the Cubans have to determine a mutually convenient place and time," he
added on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The official said the Cubans "also indicated they would like to explore areas of
additional dialogue," such as in counter-narcotics, counter-terrorism, hurricane
and disaster preparedness response.
</P>
<P>
US officials said May 23 that the Obama admistration had proposed to resume the
discussions on migration issues, wihch had been conducted every two years until
they were suspended in 2003 by former president George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
It was also Washington that proposed recently to resume direct mail service, the
official said, adding mail has for years, if not decades, been sent between the
United States and Cuba through a third country.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the new steps to engage Cuba would affect the OAS meeting in San
Pedro Sula, the senior official said "it is hoped ... that the region will
recognize that anything done within the ambit of the OAS ... should support and
foster this development, as opposed to hinder it."
</P>
<P>
US officials earlier declined to even rule out the possibility of Clinton's
skipping the OAS meeting altogether if negotiators fail to agree on terms for
bringing Cuba back within the OAS.
</P>
<P>
Even though Cuba itself rejects the OAS, analysts said, many countries want to
use the issue to either push for a lifting of the US embargo on Havana or for
their own private agendas, such as to embarrass the United States.
</P>
<P>
Since a popular Obama took office in January, analysts say, he has raised hopes
among many of his southern neighbors that he will soon lift the embargo, even if
he insists that Cuba first undertake democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the new steps, the Obama administration has called past US policy a
failure and moved to repair ties with Cuban President Raul Castro, who
officially took over the reins from older brother Fidel last year.
</P>
<P>
In April, Obama lifted travel and money transfer restrictions on Cuban-Americans
with relatives in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Instead of having Cuba as the burning issue, analyst Michael Shifter said, the
Obama team would have preferred to highlight a new era of US cooperation with
leftist but pragmatic democratic governments like those in El Salvador, Brazil
and Chile.
</P>
<P>
Her visit to San Salvador is symbolic of the shift because Funes brought to
power the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation, former leftist
guerrillas who fought the US-backed right-wing government in the 1980s civil
war.
</P>
<P>
US Congressman Eliot Engel, who chairs a subcommittee on Western hemisphere
affairs who is traveling with Clinton, saw Clinton's visit to El Salvador as
halting a lurch in Latin America toward the extreme left.
</P>
<P>
"I think it means we want to engage with El Salvador because we don't them
drifting all the way left," Engel told reporters.

Football: FIFA seek guarantees from Nigeria on Under-17 readiness
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FIFA officials will visit Nigeria in June seeking government guarantees that
this year's Under-17 World Cup can be staged as planned, world football's
governing body said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke said a commission led by FIFA vice
president Jack Warner will travel to Nigeria on June 11 and will meet Nigerian
Vice President Jonathan Goodluck in Lagos to request binding government
guarantees that Nigeria will fulfill all requirements for hosting the
competition.
</P>
<P>
"If these guarantees are given, the six venues will be Abuja, Calabar, Enugu,
Ijebu-Ode, Kano and Lagos," FIFA said in a statement. "Should the guarantees not
be issued, FIFA would withdraw the organization of this tournament from Nigeria
and an alternative host nation would be found."
</P>
<P>
FIFA's ultimatum came at the end of executive committee meetings here.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, from an objective point of view, Nigeria is not ready to host the
tournament," Warner, who is chairman of FIFA's organizing committee for the
under-17 World Cup, said in Lagos on May 21 after inspecting the prospective
venues.
</P>
<P>
"But I am a man who has always believed in Nigeria and there have been some
signs of hope and commitment," he added.
</P>
<P>
Warner said that only the match venues in Abuja and Lagos were ready, but
recommended a one-month grace period for the other problems to be sorted out.
</P>
<P>
The Under-17 World Cup is scheduled to start on October 24.

GM set for bankruptcy as Treasury readies rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The US Treasury Department on Sunday put final touches on a plan to restructure
General Motors, once the world's largest automaker and now expected to join
rival Chrysler in filing for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
Monday will be a historic day for the US automobile industry, with  President
Barack Obama poised to discuss General Motors' bankruptcy in remarks planned for
11:30 am (1530 GMT) Monday, after the auto giant officially files its bankruptcy
paperwork, US media reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, GM's new chief executive, Fritz Henderson, has scheduled a news
conference for the middle of the day in New York, where the number one US
automaker would file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The developments came as creditors holding about 54 percent of General's Motors
bonds approved a restructuring plan proposed by the US Treasury, a spokesman for
the bondholders said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 54 percent represented 975 institutions, a spokesman for the ad hoc
committee of bondholders, Elliot Sloane told AFP. Washington had warned that if
the plan were rejected, creditors risked losing everything.
</P>
<P>
The US administration had given GM until June 1 to present a viable
restructuring plan, in return for government aid, and the US Treasury Department
had given holders of General Motors until the end of the day Saturday to respond
to the rescue plan.
</P>
<P>
Agreement boosted the Treasury's plan for creating a new company shorn of labor
costs and money losing assets, in a rescue that could reach 60 billion dollars
as the state takes a 72.5 per cent ownership stake in the 101 year old company.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Canada, which has several GM factories, is also set to be digging into
its pockets for the rescue plan.
</P>
<P>
Among the backers was a committee of large investors holding about 20 percent of
GM's 27.2 billion dollars in outstanding bonds, The New York Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the bondholders would obtain the rights to buy an extra 15
percent of GM's stock at a low price. They would also control 25 percent of the
new GM, after having supported the new company's creation in bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
Bondholders who rejected the plan could still fight it in court, but the
government maintains they could end up with little or nothing if they take that
path.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, New York bankruptcy judge Arthur Gonzales was set to rule on number
three US automaker Chrysler, which filed for bankruptcy protection a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Under an expedited process, Gonzales was expected to approve the creation of a
new Chrysler that would preserve the automaker's healthiest assets and liquidate
the rest.
</P>
<P>
The new entity will be controlled by a consortium consisting of the Italian
automaker Fiat, the United Auto Workers union, and the US and Canadian
governments.
</P>
<P>
Fiat will have a 20 percent stake with the option to increase it to 35 percent;
the UAW 55 percent; and the US and Canadian governments 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The automakers' fate, the subject of debate on television talks shows, is being
closely watched in US political and economic circles.
</P>
<P>
"This is a real sad day," said former Republican presidential contender Mitt
Romney.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a son of Detroit. My dad was an auto executive. You know, I drive American
cars. I love American cars. My heart bleeds for the people in Michigan and
Detroit, for all these auto workers," he said on Fox News Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, GM had 244,000 employees around the world, about half
of them in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Republican Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, called the auto rescue
plan "a big mistake," arguing that the government had done too much to keep GM
and Chyrsler out of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNN, he held up the example of Ford, the number two US
automaker, as "an American company that hasn't taken government money and is
still producing automobiles."
</P>
<P>
Corporate leaders, meanwhile, urged the government not to overstay its welcome
in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
"I think all of us understand the need for the government to intervene and take
the actions they did," said Anne Mulcahy, chief executive of Xerox. "But I also
think there's a need for an exit plan."
</P>
<P>
The possibility of bankruptcy for such an iconic American company has been
viewed with great foreboding in a country where the automobile is deeply
embedded in the national imagination.
</P>
<P>
"The phrase 'bankrupt General Motors,' which we expect to hear uttered on Monay,
leaves Americans my age in economic shock," the writer PJ O'Rourke said in the
Wall Street Journal. "The words are as melodramatic as 'Mom's nude photos.'"

Mauritania coup chief campaigns as talks mull vote delay
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NOUAKCHOTT, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The head of last year's coup in Mauritania began a final push for votes Sunday
in the week ahead of scheduled elections as his aides took part in talks about a
possible delay to the polls.
</P>
<P>
On a trip to the north, General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz pledged to improve
living standards in the poverty-stricken nation if he returns to power after the
scheduled June 6 ballot which he is widely expected to win.
</P>
<P>
But with the main opposition boycotting next weekend's polls as little more than
a sham, much of the attention was focused on neighbouring Senegal where
international mediators are convening talks aimed at resolving the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
According to the state news agency, Aziz pledged during a campaign appearance in
the northern Atar region to work to bring about "an improvement in living
standards for every citizen, in particular the most vulnerable".
</P>
<P>
Aziz also promised to upgrade facilities in all the country's hospitals.
</P>
<P>
A source close to the opposition said that the talks in Dakar were focusing on a
proposal to delay the first round of the elections until July 21 with the second
round taking place on August 4.
</P>
<P>
Aziz denounced talk of a delay in the polls over the weekend as "rumours and
lies", but the head of the main opposition party, Ahmed Ould Daddah, said that a
deal "had existed".
</P>
<P>
"Its witnesses are numerous and credible, including representatives of the
international community and Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade," Daddah said.
</P>
<P>
"An unwritten agreement was reached 48 hours ago with the Ould Abdel Aziz camp,
but we see since then a desire from that camp to backpedal on key points," said
the leader of the Rally of Democratic Forces.
</P>
<P>
A draft accord being discussed in the Senegalese capital Dakar would also see
Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, who was toppled in last August's coup, formally resign as
president after signing a decree to usher in a transitional period under a
temporary government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
The intensive talks began in Dakar last Thursday and resumed on Sunday morning
with Senegal's Foreign Minister Cheikh Tidiane Gadio saying he was convinced
that the talks would end with an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The African Union Commissioner for Peace and Security Ramtane Lamara, the United
Nations special representative for West Africa Said Djinnit and the US and
French ambassadors to Senegal are also participating in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Ould Abdel Aziz initially took power in the northwest African nation in August
last year as head of a military junta which toppled Cheikh Abdallahi, the
country's first democratically elected president.
</P>
<P>
He then quit the military in April to run for president in a move widely seen as
a ploy to legitimise the coup. The former junta chief is running against only
three other marginal candidates who have all supported the coup.

Football: FIFA unveil 2014 Brazil World Cup venues

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joseph Blatter, president of world football's governing body FIFA, on Sunday
unveiled the name of the 12 venue cities for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after two days of FIFA executive committee meetings in the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
As expected, five major cities will host games, including the capital Brasilia
(Mane Garrincha stadium), Rio de Janeiro (Maracana), Sao Paulo (Morumbi), Belo
Horizonte (Mineirao) and Porto Alegre (Beira-Rio).
</P>
<P>
Three cities where the stadia must be built were also selected: Natal (Estrela
dos Reis Magos), Recife-Olinda (Arena Recife-Olinda) and Salvador (Arena da
Bahia).
</P>
<P>
In the competition to represent the Amazon, which makes up 43 percent of
Brazil's territory, Manaus (Vivaldao) beat out Belem.
</P>
<P>
The other venue cities are Curitiba (Arena da Baixada), Cuiaba (Verdao) and
Fortaleza (Castelao).
</P>
<P>
"There are no winning and losing cities here in Brazil," said Brazilian Football
Federation president Ricardo Terra Teixeira. "For the 12 privileged cities
chosen, it's the beginning of the work. They have a huge responsibility"
</P>
<P>
The 12 cities were chosen from 17 candidates, after inspections carried out in
January and February and based on their accessibility, infrastructure and
potential security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Florianopolis, Goiania, Campo Grande, Belem and Rio Branco all missed out.
</P>
<P>
"It was a very difficult decision to choose just 12 venues from the initial list
of 17," Blatter said. "We want to make this World Cup a sporting success and
this is the most important thing."
</P>
<P>
FIFA had already agreed to have 12 venues rather than 10 because of the size of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Rio's legendary Maracana hosted the final of the last World Cup held in Brazil,
in 1950, when Uruguay defeated the hosts 2-1 for the title.

New therapies to treat breast, lymph cancer: studies
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ORLANDO, Florida, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New therapies developed following groundbreaking clinical trials appear to
effectively target breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, according to
research unveiled Sunday at a major cancer conference.
</P>
<P>
The first therapy targeting the capacity of cancer cells to repair themselves
shows promise in treating breast cancer, according to results of two small
clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
The new agent, especially adept at targeting cancers that are most difficult to
cure, neutralizes an enzyme called PARP (poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase) and
prevents it from playing its usual role in repairing the DNA of damaged cells.
</P>
<P>
Like healthy cells, cancerous cells employ PARP to regenerate themselves after
they have been damaged by chemo-therapy treatments.
</P>
<P>
The studies examined whether breast cancers are more susceptible to chemotherapy
when the PARP enzymes have been neutralized.
</P>
<P>
The first clinical trial was conducted with 116 women suffering from so-called
triple negative breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
These involve fast-spreading tumors that account for 15 percent of the 170,000
annual cases worldwide of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
Some of the cases were treated with chemotherapy and a PARP inhibitor called
BSI-201 made by the firm BiPar Sciences, a US affiliate of the French-owned
laboratory Sanofi-Aventis.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the group was treated only with chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
After six months, about 62 percent of the patients treated with BSI-201 combined
with chemotherapy showed a comparative clinical improvement of 21 percent over
the control group, said Joyce O'Shaughnessy, of the Baylor-Charles Sammons
cancer center in Dallas, Texas.
</P>
<P>
She presented the results of the study at a conference of the American Society
of Clinical Oncology this weekend in Orlando, Florida.
</P>
<P>
The women treated with BSI-201 survived 9.2 months on average, including 6.9
months in which the cancer did not spread, compared to an average survival of
6.9 months and 3.3 months in which the cancer was in check for those who were
treated solely with chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
The second clinical study involved 54 women suffering from advanced breast
cancer linked to the gene mutation BRCA1 or BRCA2. They were treated with the
PARP blocker Olaparib made by the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical AstraZenica.
There was no control group.
</P>
<P>
The test showed that 40 percent of the patients who took the drug experienced a
reduction in their tumors, said Andrew Tutt, a cancer specialist at Kings
College in London.
</P>
<P>
In another study presented here researchers examined a vaccine on patients over
eight years that targeted follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a particularly
aggressive form of lymphatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
The study found that patients who received the BiovaxID vaccine experienced on
average disease-free survival of approximately 44 months, compared to about 30
months for patients who received a control vaccine -- an increase of 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
The BiovaxID vaccine is patient-specific, in that each dose must be individually
manufactured from tissue obtained from a patient's own cancerous tumor.
</P>
<P>
"With this vaccine, we've now moved into an era where we can safely use a
patient's immune system to effectively fight follicular lymphoma and enhance the
response to conventional chemotherapy" said lead study author Stephen Schuster.
</P>
<P>
"Because this vaccine uniquely recruits the patient's immune system to seek and
destroy only tumor B-cells, this approach may be applicable to the treatment of
other B-cell lymphomas," Schuster added.

Nigeria troops destroy militant camp: spokesman
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LAGOS, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nigeria's army said Sunday it had destroyed a rebel camp in southern Rivers
state as part of its campaign to end years of violence and kidnappings in the
oil-rich region.
</P>
<P>
"The troops of Joint Task Force (JTF) have located and destroyed a militants'
camp close to Buguma creek in Rivers State after a fierce exchange of fire with
the militants," army spokesman Rabe Abubakar said.
</P>
<P>
"The troops of JTF were fired at from the militants' camp over night and the
security outfit has no choice but to locate and destroy the camp," he said in an
e-mail to AFP.
</P>
<P>
He said the military would get "rid of the criminals who are bent on causing
unnecessary tension and apprehension in the region".
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said the military also recovered some arms and ammunition during the
raid.
</P>
<P>
Several camps operated by militants have been destroyed since May 13 when
federal troops launched their operation against fighters of the Movement for the
Emancipation of Niger Delta (MEND), Nigeria's main militant group.
</P>
<P>
But MEND said in a statement late Sunday there was no fresh attack on its camp
at Buguma.
</P>
<P>
"The leader of a small group of fighters around the Buguma creek axis in Rivers
state, Egbele has confirmed that there was no attack in his camp as claimed by
the military JTF," the group said.
</P>
<P>
"He (Egbele) said they actually asked him to cooperate by giving the impression
his camp has been over-run," MEND added.
</P>
<P>
In the past three and a half years MEND, which says it is fighting to ensure
local people have a greater share in the oil wealth, has been behind a series of
kidnappings of staff and attacks on oil installations in the region.
</P>
<P>
Unrest in the Niger Delta has reduced Nigeria's daily output to 1.76 million
barrels compared with 2.6 million barrels in January 2006.

Abortion doctor shot dead at his Kansas church

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities here on Sunday arrested a suspect in the death of a controversial
provider of late-term abortions, who was fatally shot as he walked into services
at his Kansas church, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Abortion doctor George Tiller, was shot to death just after 10:00 am (1500 GMT)
in the lobby of Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kansas, police and city
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Wichita officials said the suspect, who was not identified, was arrested some
three hours after the killing, and said they would have more details about the
alleged shooter at a press conference planned for 4 pm local time (2100 GMT
Sunday).
</P>
<P>
"It's an unfortunate incident to happen on a Sunday morning," Wichita police
captain Brent Allred told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"These things should not occur at a any time."
</P>
<P>
Long a lightning rod in the bitter US culture war over abortion, Tiller, 67,
over the years had been picketed, bombed and shot in the arms, before being
killed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred just two weeks after President Barack Obama sought "common
ground" over the divisive abortion debate in a controversial speech at one of
the top Catholic universities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The president has attempted to defuse one of the most emotive issues in US
public life by arguing that while abortion should remain legal, the government
should do all it can to limit unwanted pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
But Obama has angered the anti-abortion movement by reversing predecessor George
W. Bush's restrictions on federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research and
for family-planning groups that carry out or facilitate abortions overseas.
</P>
<P>
Obama's choice for health secretary, former Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius,
has been widely condemned by the anti-abortion movement because of her ties to
Tiller.
</P>
<P>
Tiller, one of the few doctors who still performs late-term abortions in the
United States, has been demonized by abortion opponents who regularly protested
outside his clinic.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, someone placed a bomb on the roof of the clinic, seriously damaging the
building.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Tiller was shot in both arms outside the clinic. Tiller recovered, and
his assailant received an 11-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 protesters were also arrested outside the clinic during summer-long
demonstrations in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He was acquitted in March on charges that he performed 19 illegal abortions in
2003 in a case which his lawyer described as a witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
Tiller testified during the trial that he spent years under the protection of
federal agents after the FBI discovered an anti-abortion assassination list in
1994 that listed Tiller as the top target.
</P>
<P>
Tiller also testified that he owns one of only three clinics in the United
States that perform late-term abortions, which are performed on fetuses that
would be viable outside the mother's womb.
</P>
<P>
Late-term abortions are legal in Kansas if two independent physicians agree that
the mother could suffer irreparable harm by giving birth.
</P>
<P>
Tiller was acquitted of having an illegal financial relationship with the doctor
who provided the second opinion.

First president of Guinea-Bissau dies aged 78
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BISSAU, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Luis Cabral, the first post-independence president of Guinea-Bissau who was
later toppled in a military coup, has died of a heart attack in Lisbon,
officials announced on Sunday. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
"It is with shock and sadness that the government and people of Guinea-Bissau
have learnt of the loss of one of their most illustrious sons, Luis Cabral," the
government announced in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The government was to hold an emergency session to organise preparations for a
three-day period of national mourning, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Natural Resources Minister Oscar Barbosa, a close ally of the former president,
said that Cabral had died of a heart attack in the Portuguese capital on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Cabral was a half-brother of Amilcar Cabral, long-time leader of the
Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) liberation movement, who was
assassinated in 1973 -- the year before Guinea-Bissau attained its independence
from Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Cabral ruled in Guinea-Bissau until he was overthrown in a coup led by "First
Commissar", or prime minister, Joao Bernardo Vieira on November 14, 1980.
</P>
<P>
After his ouster, Cabral was imprisoned for six months before being released
after the intervention of the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
He then spent most of the rest of his life in exile in Portugal, although he did
make a brief return to Guinea-Bissau 1999 after Vieira was toppled in another
coup.
</P>
<P>
News of his death comes less than three months after Vieira, who returned to
power in 2005 elections, was assassinated by soldiers in the hours after a bomb
attack which claimed the life of the West African country's military chief.

British PM says won't quit as poll predicts Euro election rout
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown insisted Sunday he would not quit despite a
scandal over MPs expenses and dire poll ratings for his ruling Labour Party
before crunch European and local elections.
</P>
<P>
He said the expenses furore, which has shown how lawmakers claimed from the
public purse for everything from moat cleaning to a duck island, was "appalling"
and "offends everything that I believe in".
</P>
<P>
Every member of parliament would be forced to account for all their expenses
from the last four years, he promised.
</P>
<P>
Some 13 lawmakers from Labour and the main opposition Conservatives have said
they will resign since the Daily Telegraph newspaper began publishing the leaked
claims three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
A new Sunday Telegraph/ICM poll suggested the revelations would hit Brown hard
at the European and local elections, in which Britons vote Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It suggested Labour would come third in the elections for the European
Parliament with just 17 percent, behind David Cameron's Conservatives and the
smaller centrist Liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Even more damagingly, it suggested Labour would also come third in a general
election with just 22 percent of the vote -- the worst Brown's party has done in
an opinion poll since 1987.
</P>
<P>
Some 54 percent of those polled thought Labour had been worst affected by the
expenses scandal, compared to 13 percent for the Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
But Brown, who must call a general election by the middle of next year,
dismissed suggestions he could step down to make way for a more popular leader.
</P>
<P>
"Things go up and down," he said in an interview with BBC television. "We're
going through the most difficult economic circumstances the country has faced.
</P>
<P>
"People are angry rightly because they are worried when they see taxpayers'
money wasted on their MPs and they're finding it very difficult... in a
difficult economic situation," he added, referring to Britain's recession.
</P>
<P>
He also said he wanted to introduce a "constitutional renewal" bill and was
looking at reforms including the case for a written constitution, lowering the
voting age to 16 and reform of the unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
Cameron, meanwhile, renewed his calls for a snap general election, telling the
BBC the public wanted to "sit in judgement on MPs".
</P>
<P>
Public anger over expenses is widespread and in a sermon Sunday, the leader of
the Scottish Catholic church expressed concern at the "fall from grace" of many
people in politics, saying "money (was) at the root of many difficulties".
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Keith O'Brien called on "those in public service of whatever kind who
have failed us to reclaim the high standards which we expect of them".
</P>
<P>
Turnout at European elections in Britain is usually low, due partly to
widespread Eurosceptic sentiment, and in 2004 turnout was just 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
This time, fringe parties such as the anti-EU UK Independence Party and the far-
right British National Party are expected to benefit. Commentators say the BNP
could even win its first seat at the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
An Economist magazine/YouGov poll last week found that only 31 percent of
Britons think its membership of the European Union is a good thing, compared to
37 percent who think it is bad.
</P>
<P>
ICM interviewed 1,013 adults by telephone May 27-28 for the Sunday Telegraph
poll, while YouGov questioned 2,322 adults in Britain May 22-26.

Football: Betis relegated after Osasuna, Sporting heroics
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MADRID, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Real Betis were relegated from the Spanish top-flight on a heart-breaking final
Sunday of the season, drawing 1-1 at home to Valladolid while relegation rivals
Osasuna and Sporting Gijon both won.
</P>
<P>
Betis started a point above the drop zone knowing a win would keep them in the
top tier but Sporting's 2-1 comeback win over Recreativo Huelva coupled with
Osasuna's sensational 2-1 victory against nine-man Real Madrid saw them
relegated with 42 points.
</P>
<P>
Betis, who are based in the southern city of Seville, were last relegated in
2000 but immediately won promotion the following season and have been in the
first division since 2001, finishing as high as fourth in 2005.
</P>
<P>
"It is a sad day because once again the football gods weren't on our side," said
Betis coach Jose Maria Nogues. "Betis now have to get back in the top division
for its fans and history."
</P>
<P>
Getafe, who drew 1-1 with Racing Santander, also finished on 42 points but
stayed up on goal difference while Valladolid's draw at Betis was enough to keep
them safe.
</P>
<P>
It was particularly tough for Betis duo Sergio Garcia and Ricardo Oliveira, who
cost a combined 19 million euros after being relegated with Real Zaragoza last
season.
</P>
<P>
At half-time Sporting Gijon, trailing Recre 1-0, were set to be relegated but
came back to win 2-1 and secure their top-flight status.
</P>
<P>
Sporting had spent a decade in the second division before winning promotion last
season and defied the odds to stay up with Luis Moran scoring a dramatic winner.
</P>
<P>
"It was an agonising game that felt like seven days," said Sporting coach Manolo
Preciado. "Our fans are special and their contribution throughout this season
has been pivotal."
</P>
<P>
Osasuna were third from bottom before kick off and fell behind against Real
Madrid when Gonzalo Higuain scored early on.
</P>
<P>
However, Jose Camacho's men battled back, equalising through Jaroslav Plasil
before Juanfran smashed a stunning volley past Iker Casillas to keep them in the
division.
</P>
<P>
"We reached our target although it was a bit last minute," said Camacho.
"It is clear that Osasuna need to reconstruct the squad a bit because for the
past two seasons we have been fighting for survival on the final weekends of the
season."
</P>
<P>
Michel Salgado and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar were both sent off for Real, who crashed
to a fifth successive defeat.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Espanyol bid farewell to their Montjuic stadium in style with captain
Raul Tamudo scoring a hat-trick in a 3-0 win over 10-man Malaga.
</P>
<P>
Tamudo, the club's all-time top-scorer and an icon after spending his entire
career at Espanyol, scored twice in the first half and completed his treble with
a 56th-minute penalty to give the Montjuic the perfect send-off.
</P>
<P>
Espanyol's new Cornella-El Prat stadium looked destined to host second-division
football next season before the club produced a sensational late run to beat the
drop.
</P>
<P>
With 26 games played Espanyol were bottom of the table, seven points from
safety, but Argentine coach Mauricio Pochettino turned things around and a burst
of form saw the club win eight out of their ten final games.
</P>
<P>
Malaga coach Antonio Tapia confirmed that he would not be in charge of the club
next season, saying that the time was right to step down.
</P>
<P>
"I won't be coach next season," said Tapia. "After an excellent season I think
it is the ideal time for my family and I to end this chapter in my life."
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Sevilla defeated relegated Numancia 2-0 in a game with little at
stake.
</P>
<P>
Sevilla already had a Champions League spot wrapped up before the game and coach
Manolo Jimenez tested fringe players with next season in mind.
</P>
<P>
Jimenez was recently rewarded with a contract extension until 2010 after getting
Sevilla into the Champions League by finishing third and now has the task of
trying to close the gap on the top two of Barcelona and Real Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Numancia will prepare for life in the second division with the highlight of
their campaign a 1-0 victory over treble-winners Barcelona in Soria on the
opening day of the season.

Golf: Frenchman Cevaer shocks field to win European Open
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 30, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
France's Christian Cevaer, ranked a lowly 449th in the world, shocked a strong
field to win the European Open here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After four rounds of golf that saw 45 changes of the lead, the 39-year-old
Frenchman, who has failed to make the top-30 in his last 15 starts and whose
only previous Tour victory was the 2004 Spanish Open, beat England's Steve
Webster, Scot Gary Orr and Spaniard Alvaro Quiros by a shot.
</P>
<P>
His winning total of 281, seven under par, was 13 strokes more than Ross Fisher
took on the same London Club course last year - and his 74 was the highest last
round by a winner all season.
</P>
<P>
But while Webster and Quiros both became more victims of the 471-yard last when
tied for the lead - both carved their drives into the crowd, with Quiros hitting
spectators with his first and second shots - Cevaer kept his nerve.
</P>
<P>
During the week the par four played to an average of nearly 4.7, with 154
bogeys, 48 doubles and 26 sevens or worse, but Cevaer parred it the first two
days, birdied it in the third round and finished with the par he needed.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a long player, but I used my utility club and it worked out great," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I made a point that no matter what happened just enjoy my golf, enjoy my skills
and hang in there."
</P>
<P>
He played the front nine in 39 and did not have a birdie until the long 15th,
but the problems meant that it brought him back into a share of top spot.
</P>
<P>
And then three closing pars were good enough to give him the 300,000 pounds
first prize - easily the biggest of his 16-year professional career.
</P>
<P>
At 196th on the "Race to Dubai" money list entering the week he would have been
delighted just to secure his card for next season, but now he has a five-year
Tour exemption.

Overnight leader Jeev Milkha Singh of India was still at the top of the
leaderboard in the European Open after windy conditions took a toll of scores at
the London Club in Kent on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Singh shot a one under par 71 to leave him in the joint lead with France's
Christian Cevaer who went one better with a round of 70.
</P>
<P>
But hot on their heels was 20-year-old rising star Rory McIlroy who caught the
eye with a four-under-par 68 that saw the Northern Irishman close to within
three shots of the leading duo after he'd been in 25th place overnight.
</P>
<P>
Alongside McIlroy in joint third place were England's Chris Wood and Spain's
Alvaro Quiros.
</P>
<P>
Singh, the world number 39, defied the conditions to cover the final six holes
in a superb four under par on a day where Spain's Sergio Garcia was one of
several players to finish with a triple bogey seven.
</P>
<P>
Before his round Singh said it was vital for the progress of golf in India that
it became an Olympic sport.
</P>
<P>
"Golf not being an Olympic sport we have not been getting any funding from the
government," Singh said.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully in October it does and I think what happens after that is the
government is going to allocate land in each and every city to have a public
driving range so that a normal human being can go there and try a hand at it.
</P>
<P>
"That's when it's going to be really big in our country. It's the fastest-
growing sport in our country, but it's the only way this game is going to get
famous and close to cricket.
</P>
<P>
"Our population is more than a billion and I'm sure there's going to be a lot of
talent out there.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's a public driving range in our country and there's only
one public golf course right now. Everything is private.
</P>
<P>
"I remember there were a lot of good players when I was growing up who just
didn't take it up - they just went back to the parents' business."
</P>
<P>
Last week McIlroy shot 65 at Wentworth before falling back in the final round
and it appears injury may have been a factor, although it seems as if he is
getting close to finding a cure.
</P>
<P>
McIlroy, who revealed he'd been struggling with a "little niggle" in his back,
said: "I had a really nice bath last night, got into bed and watched the golf in
the States. I'm a bit of a golf geek to be honest."

South Ossetia poll set to bolster rebel leader
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TSKHINVALI, Georgia, June 1, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The party backing South Ossetia's leader Eduard Kokoity was on course Sunday to
sweep legislative elections and tighten the grip of the strongman president on
the Georgian rebel region.
</P>
<P>
Initial results showed Yedinstvo (Unity) well ahead in the vote in the
mountainous rebel region that was the subject of a war last year between Moscow
and Tbilisi and is recognised as independent by Russia and Nicaragua alone.
</P>
<P>
The elections were marked by a sidelining of the local opposition who accuse
Kokoity of seeking a loyal parliamentary majority to push through an amendment
allowing him to run again for office when his second term lapses in 2011.
</P>
<P>
Based on an initial count of almost 61 percent of the vote, South Ossetia's
central election commission said Unity had polled 48.04 percent while the
People's Party, also largely uncritical of Kokoity, won 18.47 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Communists were second with 23.51 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Final results were due at 0600 GMT on Monday with officials estimating the
turnout at 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Only four parties are competing for the 34 seats in the parliament and the
central election commission barred the only two parties not loyal to Kokoity.
</P>
<P>
The name of Unity also bears more than a passing resemblance to Russia's ruling
party Edinaya Rossiya (United Russia) and it even used pictures of United Russia
party leader Boris Gryzlov on its campaign literature.
</P>
<P>
But Russia -- which outraged the West by recognising South Ossetia as
independent in the wake of the August war with Georgia -- has said South Ossetia
should not amend the existing term limits in its constitution.
</P>
<P>
Kokoity said it was too early to say whether he planned to run again to lead the
region of 50,000 people although he did not rule out that possibility.
</P>
<P>
"There are two and half years left till then and a lot left to do. We are
working and working now. I am not thinking about it yet," he said in an
interview with AFP.
</P>
<P>
"With what happened in August we need three to four years to rebuild," Kokoity
said.
</P>
<P>
Opposition activities said voting would not make a difference. "I plan to sit at
home. There's nothing we can do," said Alan Gassiyev, an opposition leader,
calling the polls "completely illegal."
</P>
<P>
Critics accuse Kokoity, an ex-wrestling champion, of muzzling opponents and
stealing the money sent from Russia.
</P>
<P>
As the reconstruction in the province stalled this winter, the opposition also
accuses the separatist leader and his circle of diverting lorries carrying
construction material and humanitarian aid to traffic the goods in Russia.
</P>
<P>
But despite the slow pace of reconstruction in the republic many praise Kokoity
for his leadership during the August conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Kokoity has done a lot for the people of South Ossetia, he's fought 20 years
for this country," Angela Tedeyeva, a 32-year-old teacher, said as she cast her
ballot.
</P>
<P>
Georgia ridiculed the vote, with the country's reintegration minister Temur
Iakobashvili saying the elections were "nothing but clownery, a farce and a
redistribution of a criminal power."
</P>
<P>
But Kokoity insisted the elections were in strict accordance with law, saying
the polls were "a maturity test for the small independent state."
</P>
<P>
His domestic critics are concerned that the high number of polling stations  in
the villages which were used to be populated by ethnic Georgians and which are
now nearly empty will be used to falsify the election results.
</P>
<P>
As the row over Kokoity's push for a third term threatens to become an
embarrassment for Moscow, there are signs the Kremlin is scaling back its
support for the South Ossetian leader.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Naryshkin, the head of the Russian presidential administration, said on
Russian television this month that South Ossetia should not change the existing
term limits in its constitution.
</P>
<P>
Moscow and Tbilisi fought a brief but intense war last August over the region,
which had enjoyed de facto independence since the early 1990s thanks to tacit
Russian support.

A party strongly supportive of the leader of Georgia's breakaway region of South
Ossetia was well ahead in parliamentary elections Sunday, initial results

</P>
<P>
The apparent dominance of Yedinstvo (Unity) in the legislative elections should
allow president Eduard Kokoity to cement his grip on the mountainous rebel

GM set for bankruptcy as Treasury readies rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The US Treasury Department on Sunday put final touches on a plan to restructure
General Motors, once the world's largest automaker and now expected to join
rival Chrysler in filing for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
Monday will be a historic day for the US automobile industry, with  President
Barack Obama poised to discuss General Motors' bankruptcy in remarks planned for
11:30 am (1530 GMT) Monday, after auto giant officially files its bankruptcy
paperwork, US media reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, GM's new chief executive, Fritz Henderson, has scheduled a news
conference for the middle of the day in New York, where the number one US
automaker would file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The US administration had given GM until June 1 to present a viable
restructuring plan, in return for government aid, and the US Treasury Department
had given holders of General Motors until the end of the day Saturday to respond
to the rescue plan.
</P>
<P>
The plan was approved by holders of about 54 percent of the company's bond debt
according to Elliot Sloane, spokesman for an ad hoc bondholders committee.
Washington had warned that if the plan were rejected, creditors risked losing
everything.
</P>
<P>
Agreement boosted the Treasury's plan for creating a new company shorn of labor
costs and money losing assets, in a rescue that could reach 60 billion dollars
as the state takes a 72.5 per cent ownership stake in the 101 year old company.
</P>
<P>
Canada, which has several GM factories, is also set to be digging into its
pockets for the rescue plan.
</P>
<P>
Among the backers was a committee of large investors holding about 20 percent of
GM's 27.2 billion dollars in outstanding bonds, The New York Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the bondholders would obtain the rights to buy an extra 15
percent of GM's stock at a low price. They would also control 25 percent of the
new GM, after having supported the new company's creation in bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
Bondholders who rejected the plan could still fight it in court, but the
government maintains they could end up with little or nothing if they take that
path.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Monday New York bankruptcy judge Arthur Gonzales was set to rule on
number three US automaker Chrysler, which filed for bankruptcy protection a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
Under an expedited process, Gonzales was expected to approve the creation of a
new Chrysler that would preserve the automaker's healthiest assets and liquidate
the rest.
</P>
<P>
The new entity will be controlled by a consortium consisting of the Italian
automaker Fiat, the United Auto Workers union, and the US and Canadian
governments.
</P>
<P>
Fiat will have a 20 percent stake with the option to increase it to 35 percent;
the UAW 55 percent; and the US and Canadian governments 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The automakers' fate, the subject of debate on television talks shows, is being
closely watched in US political and economic circles.
</P>
<P>
"This is a real sad day," said former Republican presidential contender Mitt
Romney.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a son of Detroit. My dad was an auto executive. You know, I drive American
cars. I love American cars. My heart bleeds for the people in Michigan and
Detroit, for all these auto workers," he said on Fox News.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, GM had 244,000 employees around the world, about half
of them in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Republican Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, called the auto rescue
plan "a big mistake," arguing that the government had done too much to keep GM
and Chyrsler out of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNN, he held up the example of Ford, the number two US
automaker, as "an American company that hasn't taken government money and is
still producing automobiles."
</P>
<P>
Corporate leaders, meanwhile, urged the government not to overstay its welcome
in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
"I think all of us understand the need for the government to intervene and take
the actions they did," said Anne Mulcahy, chief executive of Xerox. "But I also
think there's a need for an exit plan."
</P>
<P>
The possibility of bankruptcy for such an iconic American company has been
viewed with great foreboding in a country where the automobile is deeply
embedded in the national imagination.
</P>
<P>
"The phrase 'bankrupt General Motors,' which we expect to hear uttered on Monay,
leaves Americans my age in economic shock," the writer PJ O'Rourke said in the
Wall Street Journal. "The words are as melodramatic as 'Mom's nude photos.'"

Waste piles up in Sicily as collectors strike
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
palermo, Italy, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sicily's city of Palermo was buried in a mountain of waste on Sunday as garbage
collectors pressed on with a strike over fears that their struggling employer
will not pay them.
</P>
<P>
Piles of trash as high as two metres (6 feet 5 inches) lined apartment buildings
and church walls across the city, as firefighters received reports of some 200
rubbish fires sparked by hot temperatures on the island.
</P>
<P>
Garbagemen have been on strike or have done limited trash pick-ups as they
refuse to work overtime for fear of not getting paid by their employer, the
trash collection company Amia, which is 150 million euros in the hole.
</P>
<P>
The city council dropped Sunday a plan to raise the waste management tax by 30
percent to help Amia after a stormy municipal meeting.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Diego Cammarata said the strike was "seriously irresponsible" as the city
was more and more "invaded by trash in an intolerable and indecent way."
</P>
<P>
The collectors' union decided to remain on strike until they received guarantees
on the future of their employer.
</P>
<P>
They also demanded better work equipment, saying that they were not working in
safe conditions.
</P>
<P>
The strike recalls the rubbish problems that have hit Naples, where the mafia
has been blamed for a garbage crisis in a city that has been on a "waste state
of emergency" for 14 years.

Yachting: Volvo race changes rules to attract more women
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Galway, Ireland, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Organisers of the Volvo Ocean Race announced Sunday changes to the next edition
of the round-the-world yacht race aimed at boosting the number of women who take
part.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the 36-year history of the event, formerly called the
Whitbread race, no women sailors are taking part in the 2008-09 edition of the
race, which involves eight teams and began in Alicante, Spain in October.
</P>
<P>
Organisers decided that female teams will be allowed to carry 12 sailors, two of
whom may be men, instead of just 10 for an all male team during the next edition
of the world's most grueling offshore yacht race scheduled for 2011-12.
</P>
<P>
The change in the rules for the crew make-up for the next race was "an effort to
encourage female participation", they said in a statement following a meeting in
Galway, Ireland where current race entries have made a stop.
</P>
<P>
Specialists say female entries have disappeared from the race due to the
selection of the more powerful Volvo Open 70 yachts in 2004, which are longer
and require more physical force to control than the old Ocean 60 yachts that
were used before.
</P>
<P>
"These boats are animals," said Lisa McDonald, who attempted to raise a mixed
campaign for the last race with her husband Neal after skippering Amer Sports
Too in 2001.
</P>
<P>
"They are wild and furious and pretty powerful so until there is a new rule, it
is difficult to imagine girls being competitive in them," she told the Volvo
Ocean Race website in January.
</P>
<P>
The organisers of the Volvo Ocean Race also announced several other changes for
future editions designed to make the race more competitive and less costly.
</P>
<P>
The maximum weight for the keel fin and bulb of participating yachts in the
future will be set at 7,400 kilogrammes and headfoils will be banned.
</P>
<P>
Organisers are also looking to ban two-boat testing which favours teams with
bigger budgets. One of Swedish team Ericsson's two entries in the ongoing Volvo
Ocean Race, the Ericsson 4, currently leads the overall classification.
</P>
<P>
Volvo is seeking to make it possible for a team to be competitive with a budget
of between 15-20 million euros in future race. They hope lower costs will
attract about a dozen teams, instead of the 7 or 8 in recent editions.
</P>
<P>
The current Volvo Ocean Race is to conclude in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in June
after negotiating 10 stages over 37,000 nautical miles.

Millvina Dean, the last remaining survivor of the sinking of the Titanic in

</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Gladys Dean, known to friends as Millvina, was only nine weeks old

She survived after being bundled up in a sack and carried to safety. Her mother
Georgette Eva and brother Bertram also made it, but her father, Bertram Frank,
was among those who died.
</P>
<P>
Dean died in a private nursing home near Ashurst in the southern English county
of Hampshire, according to the BBC and Britain's domestic Press Association news
agency. Staff there refused to comment late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Dean's family had boarded the Titanic at Southampton, heading for a new life in
Kansas where her father hoped to open a tobacconist shop.
</P>
<P>
Born on February 12, 1912, Dean was the youngest passenger on board. At the
time, RMS Titanic was the most luxurious, most technically advanced and largest
passenger liner in the world.
</P>
<P>
She was dubbed "unsinkable", but it took just two hours and 40 minutes for her
to disappear into the icy waters of the Atlantic after striking an iceberg at
11:40 pm on April 14.
</P>
<P>
Dean was taken back to Southampton with her family after the disaster and did
not find out that she had been on board until she was eight years old and her
mother was planning to remarry.
</P>
<P>
According to enthusiasts' website Encyclopedia Titanica (ET), Dean worked for
the government as a cartographer during World War II and then for an engineering
company.
</P>
<P>
She told reporters that it was not until the wreckage of the liner was found in
1985 that she suddenly became a celebrity, taking part in documentaries and
giving media interviews.
</P>
<P>
Dean was invited to complete her family's ill-fated journey to the United States
in 1997 aboard the QE2, and accepted, although she turned down an offer to
attend the premier of the movie "Titanic" because it would be too upsetting.
</P>
<P>
She moved into a private nursing home in Hampshire after breaking her hip three
years ago, and after struggling to pay the bills was forced to sell off some of
her memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
At auction in October 2008 she raised 31,150 pounds (40,000 euros, 53,900
dollars), selling off rare prints of the liner signed by the artists as well as
compensation letters sent to her mother by the Titanic Relief Fund.
</P>
<P>
Dean was also forced to sell a 100-year-old suitcase filled with clothes donated
to her family by the people of New York when they arrived after being rescued.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the auction, friends including members of the British Titanic
Society and the Belfast Titanic Society -- the liner was built in Belfast in
Northern Ireland-- set up a campaign to secure her future.
</P>
<P>
Among the donors to the Millvina Fund were Hollywood actors Kate Winslet and
Leonardo DiCaprio, who starred in the 1997 "Titanic" film. The pair and the
film's director, James Cameron, reportedly donated 30,000 US dollars in total.
</P>
<P>
The last remaining US survivor, Lillian Asplund, died in her home in May 2006 at
the age of 99. She was just five years old when the Titanic went down.

Support for EU treaty rising in ailing Ireland: poll
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
dublin, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Support for the European Union's Lisbon treaty is consolidating in recession-hit
Ireland, according to a poll released Sunday, ahead of a second referendum
likely to be held by October.
</P>
<P>
The TNS mrbi poll for Monday's Irish Times found support has increased by two
points to 54 percent on a similar survey a fortnight ago, while the percentage
of "no" voters has fallen one point to 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen percent said they did not know, down one point.
</P>
<P>
In a shock result in a referendum last June, 53.4 percent voted "no" and 46.6
percent voted "yes", sparking a major crisis in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Of the 27 EU nations, only Ireland is constitutionally bound to hold a
referendum on the treaty, which is designed to improve decision-making in a
greatly expanded bloc. It must be ratified by all member states.
</P>
<P>
Dublin is seeking a number of guarantees from Brussels, including on the right
to make its own laws on tax, defence and abortion, before holding another vote,
likely before the end of the October.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Times said the "yes" side has maintained a consistent and steadily
growing lead in its three polls since the beginning of 2009, despite a collapse
in support for the coalition government of Prime Minister Brian Cowen.
</P>
<P>
The former Celtic Tiger economy has been devastated by the financial crisis, and
voters were asked if, in the light of the recession, they thought it was better
to be part of the EU.
</P>
<P>
A substantial 81 percent thought it was (up two points), 10 percent thought it
was not (no change) and nine percent had no opinion (down two).
</P>
<P>
The pollsters interviewed 2,000 voters face-to-face between May 26 and 28.

Recession-hit Croatia votes in local polls
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ZAGREB, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters in recession-hit Croatia cast ballots in the second round of local and
regional elections on Sunday seen as a referendum on the governing coalition's
handling of the global economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Partial results released several hours after polls closed at 7:00pm (1700 GMT)
showed that the main opposition Social Democrats were set to retain power in the
capital Zagreb as their candidate and incumbent mayor was re-elected.
</P>
<P>
Milan Bandic, seeking his fourth term, garnered 61.74 percent of the votes,
according to results from 573 out of 601 polling stations.
</P>
<P>
But in the second city of Split, on the central Adriatic coast, independent
Zeljko Kerum appeared set for victory, according to partial results.
</P>
<P>
The polls gave some four million voters the right for the first time to directly
elect mayors, county prefects and municipal heads, along with 21 county
assemblies and more than 550 city and town councils.
</P>
<P>
Although a final figure was not yet available, turnout appeared to be low with
the electoral commission saying that 26.53 percent of the electorate had voted
by 1400 GMT.
</P>
<P>
On May 17, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader's ruling conservative Croatian Democratic
Union (HDZ) was re-elected in most counties in the first round while the SDP
asserted their control in major cities.
</P>
<P>
The HDZ and its coalition partners won seven prefect posts and held a majority
in 14 out of 21 county assemblies. The SDP got four county prefects and secured
control of five county assemblies.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said the vote confirmed that the SDP and left bloc dominate in
more developed parts of Croatia as well as in cities, while the HDZ and right-
wing parties are more popular in less developed and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The HDZ, founded by late nationalist leader Franjo Tudjman, returned to power in
2003 after three years in opposition. Sanader has since shaken off the HDZ's
hardline nationalist legacy and transformed it into a party that is aiming to
lead Croatia to becoming the European Union's 28th member by 2011.

Fiji won the final leg of the IRB World Sevens Series here on Sunday with a
20-19 victory over South Africa, who were crowned overall champions.
</P>
<P>
Fiji's win saw them leapfrog England into second place in the final standings,
but a full 30 points behind South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Paul Treu's side finish the season with 132 points, ahead of Fiji (102), England
(98), New Zealand (88), Argentina (68) and Kenya (64).
</P>
<P>
In a breathless final Emosi Vucago put the Fijians ahead but Ryno Benjamin's
converted score edged the Boks ahead 7-5.
</P>

The islanders rebounded with tries from Pio Tuwai and Osea Kolinisau for a 15-7
half-time lead.
</P>

In the second half Vereniki Goneva looked to have put the game beyond doubt as
Fiji dominated for large periods but Gio Aplon scored and then, at 20-12 down,
Renfred Dazel broke free in midfield and raced away to score another.

<P>
An Iraqi sports reporter was killed and a television host wounded on Sunday when
a bomb attached to the victim's car exploded in the northern city of Mosul, a
police official told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The blast killed Alaa Abdul Wahab, a correspondent for the Al-Baghdadia channel
and a leading newspaper journalist, and wounded Dr Sultan Jurjis, a university
academic and sports presenter with a rival TV station.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Abdul Wahab was killed and Dr Jurjis was injured when a sticky bomb put in
the former's car exploded," said a Mosul police official.
</P>
<P>
The bomb went off in Al-Shurta district in the north of Mosul, 370 kilometres

</P>
<P>
Mosul remains plagued by violence despite security improvements in many other
areas of Iraq. Elements from Al-Qaeda and former insurgents who have fled other
parts of the country regularly carry out attacks in the city.

GM poised for bankruptcy as Treasury readies rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Barack Obama discuss General Motor's bankruptcy in remarks planned for
11:30 am (1530 GMT) Monday, after auto giant officially files its bankruptcy
paperwork, US media reported.
</P>
<P>
CNN reported Sunday that Obama will explain the rationale for the filing and his
hopes that the bankruptcy filing offers the best hope for the company's
turnaround.
</P>
<P>
The president's administration had given GM until June 1 to present a viable
restructuring plan, in return for government aid, and the US Treasury Department
had given holders of General Motors until the end of the day Saturday to respond
to the plan.
</P>
<P>
The plan was approved by holders of about 54 percent of the company's bond debt
according to Elliot Sloane, spokesman for an ad hoc bondholders committee.
</P>
<P>
GM's new chief executive, Fritz Henderson, also has scheduled a news conference
for midday Monday in New York.
</P>
<P>
General Motors got a boost Sunday as holders of more than half its bond debt
agreed to a US Treasury rescue plan that would create a new company shorn of
labor costs and money losing assets.
</P>
<P>
The rescue could reach 60 billion dollars with the state taking a 72.5 per cent
ownership stake in the 101 year old company. Canada, which has several GM
factories, also will be digging into its pockets.
</P>
<P>
The new Treasury rescue plan would give bondholders up to 25 percent of the
company. Washington had warned that if the plan were rejected, creditors risked
losing everything.
</P>
<P>
Among the backers was a committee of large investors holding about 20 percent of
GM's 27.2 billion dollars in outstanding bonds, The New York Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the bondholders would obtain the rights to buy an extra 15
percent of GM's stock at a low price. They would also control 25 percent of the
new GM, after having supported the new company's creation in bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
Bondholders who rejected the plan could still fight it in bankruptcy court, but
the government has warned they could end up with little or nothing if they take
that path.
</P>
<P>
The New York bankruptcy court also is expected to rule Monday on number three US
automaker Chrysler, which filed for bankruptcy protection a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Under an expedited process, judge Arthur Gonzales was expected to approve the
creation of a new Chrysler, called 'New Carco,' which would preserve the
automaker's healthiest assets and liquidate the rest.
</P>
<P>
The new entity will be controlled by a consortium consisting of the Italian
automaker Fiat, the United Auto Workers union, and the US and Canadian
governments.
</P>
<P>
Fiat will have a 20 percent stake with the option to increase it to 35 percent;
the UAW 55 percent; and the US and Canadian governments 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The automakers fate, the subject of debate on television talks shows, is being
closely watched in US political and economic circles.
</P>
<P>
"This is a real sad day," said former Republican presidential contender Mitt
Romney.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a son of Detroit. My dad was an auto executive. You know, I drive American
cars. I love American cars. My heart bleeds for the people in Michigan and
Detroit, for all these auto workers," he said on Fox News.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, GM had 244,000 employees around the world, about half
of them in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Mitch McConnell, the senate minority leader, called the auto rescue plan "a big
mistake," arguing that the government had done too much to keep GM and Chyrsler
out of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNN, he held up the example of Ford, the number two US
automaker, as "an American company that hasn't taken government money and is
still producing automobiles."
</P>
<P>
Corporate leaders, meanwhile, urged the government not to overstay its welcome
in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
"I think all of us understand the need for the government to intervene and take
the actions they did," said Anne Mulcahy, chief executive of Xerox. "But I also
think there's a need for an exit plan."
</P>
<P>
The possibility of bankruptcy for such an iconic American company has been
viewed with great foreboding in a country where the automobile is deeply
embedded in the national imagination.
</P>
<P>
"The phrase 'bankrupt General Motors,' which we expect to hear uttered on Monay,
leaves Americans my age in economic shock," the writer PJ O'Rourke said in the
Wall Street Journal. "The words are as melodramatic as 'Mom's nude photos.'"

South Ossetia poll set to bolster rebel leader
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TSKHINVALI, Georgia, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The party backing South Ossetia's leader Eduard Kokoity was on course Sunday to
sweep legislative elections and tighten the grip of the strongman president on
the Georgian rebel region.
</P>
<P>
Initial results showed Yedinstvo (Unity) well ahead in the vote in the
mountainous rebel region that was the subject of a war last year between Moscow
and Tbilisi and is recognized as independent by Russia and Nicaragua alone.
</P>
<P>
The elections were marked by a sidelining of the local opposition who accuse
Kokoity of seeking a loyal parliamentary majority to push through an amendment
allowing him to run again for office when his second term lapses in 2011.
</P>
<P>
Based on an initial count of almost eight percent of the vote, South Ossetia's
central election commission said Unity had polled 58.62 percent while the
People's Party, also largely uncritical of Kokoity, won 20.35 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Communists were third with 14.6 percent of the vote. Final results were due
at 0600 GMT on Monday with officials estimating the turnout at 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Only four parties are competing for the 34 seats in the parliament and the
central election commission barred the only two parties not loyal to Kokoity.
</P>
<P>
The name of Unity also bears more that a passing resemblance to Russia's ruling
party Edinaya Rossiya (United Russia) and it even used pictures of United Russia
party leader Boris Gryzlov on its campaign literature.
</P>
<P>
But Russia -- which outraged the West by recognising South Ossetia as
independent in the wake of the August war with Georgia -- has said South Ossetia
should not amend the existing term limits in its constitution.
</P>
<P>
Kokoity said it was too early to say whether he planned to run again to lead the
region of 50,000 people although he did not rule out that possibility.
</P>
<P>
"There are two and half years left till then and a lot left to do. We are
working and working now. I am not thinking about it yet," he said in an
interview with AFP.
</P>
<P>
"With what happened in August we need three to four years to rebuild," Kokoity
said.
</P>
<P>
Opposition activities said voting would not make a difference. "I plan to sit at
home. There's nothing we can do," said Alan Gassiyev, an opposition leader,
calling the polls "completely illegal."
</P>
<P>
Critics accuse Kokoity, an ex-wrestling champion, of muzzling opponents and
stealing the money sent from Russia.
</P>
<P>
As the reconstruction in the province stalled this winter, the opposition also
accuses the separatist leader and his circle of diverting lorries carrying
construction material and humanitarian aid to traffic the goods in Russia.
</P>
<P>
But despite the slow pace of reconstruction in the republic many praise Kokoity
for his leadership during the August conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Kokoity has done a lot for the people of South Ossetia, he's fought 20 years
for this country," Angela Tedeyeva, a 32-year-old teacher, said as she cast her
ballot.
</P>
<P>
Georgia ridiculed the vote, with the country's reintegration minister Temur
Iakobashvili saying the elections were "nothing but clownery, a farce and a
redistribution of a criminal power."
</P>
<P>
But Kokoity insisted the elections were in strict accordance with law, saying
the polls were "a maturity test for the small independent state."
</P>
<P>
His domestic critics are concerned that the high number of polling stations  in
the villages which were used to be populated by ethnic Georgians and which are
now nearly empty will be used to falsify the election results.
</P>
<P>
As the row over Kokoity's push for a third term threatens to become an
embarrassment for Moscow, there are signs the Kremlin is scaling back its
support for the South Ossetian leader.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Naryshkin, the head of the Russian presidential administration, said on
Russian television this month that South Ossetia should not change the existing
term limits in its constitution.
</P>
<P>
Moscow and Tbilisi fought a brief but intense war last August over the region,
which had enjoyed de facto independence since the early 1990s thanks to tacit
Russian support.

Israel's Barak visits US in bid to heal rift
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Jerusalem, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak will try to heal a growing rift with his
country's main ally over the Middle East peace process when he starts talks with
top officials in the United States on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Barak is likely to devote a lot of time to easing tensions, although the talks
were originally planned to focus mainly on bilateral defence ties and US-led
international efforts to halt Iran's nuclear drive, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day trip, he is expected to meet Vice President Joe Biden,
Secretary of Defence Robert Gates, National Security Adviser James Jones and
President Barack Obama's special envoy to the Middle East, George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
The defence chief is also expected to discuss US arms sales to Israel, including
a request for it to buy up to 75 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters in a deal worth as
much as 15.2 billion dollars and other advanced weapon systems, a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
Barak's visit comes just two weeks after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held
his first meeting with Obama in Washington, revealing deep divisions over ways
to move forwards towards Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
The hawkish premier sparked international criticism over his repeated refusal to
endorse the creation of a Palestinian state, a bedrock principle of
international peacemaking efforts over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have intensified, with Israel rejecting repeated US calls to halt all
settlement activity in the occupied West Bank, the major part of the proposed
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Barak, a former prime minister and head of the centre-left Labour party, aims to
use his personal ties to avert a crisis between Washington and Netanyahu's
right-leaning government, a senior official told AFP.
</P>
<P>
But it remains unclear whether Barak will be able to ease the tensions as he
himself has said that Israel must maintain its right to continue building within
the boundaries of large settlement blocs.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that the prime minister made Israel's positions and needs clear to the
US administration. The dialogue will take time and it will have many ups and
downs," the Labour leader has told reporters.
</P>
<P>
One official said Barak will propose that within a short time Israel would
dismantle dozens of illegal outposts in the West Bank if the United States lets
Israel go on building inside existing settlements to meet "natural growth."
</P>
<P>
A senior Israeli official complained that Obama -- who has vowed to pursue
Middle East peace talks as part of a changed approach to the region -- is
placing unfair demands on the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans have demanded almost nothing from the Palestinians but are asking
Israel to take steps that are a real sacrifice. These demands are unfair," he
told AFP on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Despite discord over the Middle East peace talks, Obama eased Israeli concerns
over his efforts to persuade Iran to halt its nuclear programme in direct
negotiations, with the president saying the success of the dialogue would be
assessed by the year's end.
</P>
<P>
"This dialogue ought to be short and should have milestones to check whether it
is serious or not," Barak said recently. "I believe the chances that talks will
halt Iran's nuclear programme are very low."
</P>
<P>
The former chief of staff reiterated that Israel would not rule out military
action against nuclear sites in the Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
"Israel believes that no option should be removed from the table," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel, widely considered to be the Middle East's sole if undeclared nuclear
armed power, suspects Iran is using its nuclear programme to develop atomic
weapons, a charge Tehran has long denied.

Troops hunt Taliban as Pakistan says victory near
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PESHAWAR, Pakistan, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pakistan's defence secretary said Sunday that a month-long offensive to crush
Taliban fighters in northwest Swat could end within days, as fierce fighting
spilled into a nearby tribal area.
</P>
<P>
Swat valley's main town Mingora is back in government hands, the military
announced late Saturday, and security officials said they were now pursuing the
top leadership of the hardline Taliban movement into the nearby mountains.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Defence Syed Athar Ali told a security forum in Singapore that
three targeted northwest districts were almost clear of Taliban rebels.
</P>
<P>
"Operations in Swat, Buner and adjoining areas have almost met complete
success," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Only five to ten percent of the job is remaining and hopefully within the next
two to three days these pockets of resistance will be cleared."
</P>
<P>
However, chief military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas told AFP that it was
impossible to estimate when the offensive would end.
</P>
<P>
"The operation is continuing in all of the areas and at this stage we cannot
give any timeframe," he said.
</P>
<P>
The army remains locked in battle in some areas, but the fall of Mingora was a
critical milestone in an offensive launched after the Taliban thrust to within
100 kilometres (60 miles) of Islamabad in April.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's military also reported that 25 militants and seven soldiers were
killed in clashes in South Waziristan near the Afghan border, a bolt-hole for
Taliban and Al-Qaeda-linked militants south of the current army bombardment.
</P>
<P>
"Miscreants attacked a security forces checkpost last night (Saturday) in
Spinkai Raghzai, South Waziristan agency. The attack was repulsed successfully,
inflicting heavy casualties on militants," it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen militants and three soldiers died in the clash in Spinkai Raghzai, while
elsewhere in the semi-autonomous tribal area 10 insurgents and four troops
including a lieutenant died when rebels attacked a military convoy.
</P>
<P>
Civilians have started fleeing the area fearing a fresh military onslaught, but
the army has denied an imminent assault on Waziristan, where militants branded
by Washington as the greatest terror threat to the West are holed up.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which is firmly backing the current military drive, had
warned that the rebels threaten Pakistan's very existence.
</P>
<P>
Officials have said that lower-ranking Taliban leaders had been killed but it
was harder to get to the top leaders, who had a network of hardcore militants
around them and had slipped into the rugged mountain terrain.
</P>
<P>
"They will be eliminated wherever we find them," said one military official, who
did not wish to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media, adding:
"We believe that they are somewhere in the mountains."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has slapped a 600,000-dollar price on the head of firebrand Swat
Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah for masterminding the nearly two-year
uprising in the valley to enforce sharia law.
</P>
<P>
The government has also offered rewards for 21 rebel chiefs -- wanted dead or
alive -- from Swat. The military claims to have killed 1,244 militants since the
offensive began, although the numbers are impossible to verify.
</P>
<P>
As the government ups its campaign to stamp out the militants, fears are growing
of a wave of revenge attacks.
</P>
<P>
The northwestern capital Peshawar and the eastern cultural centre of Lahore have
both been rocked by deadly explosions in the last five days, killing a total of
39 people and wounding hundreds more.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Pakistan Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud has claimed Wednesday's
suicide bombing on a police building in Lahore, and warned of more "massive
attacks" to avenge the Swat military operation.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2.4 million people have fled the current offensive, and the military
relaxed a curfew Sunday in most parts of the northwest including Mingora to
allow people trapped on the roads to return home or leave the region.
</P>
<P>
Senior Red Cross officials said Sunday they were "gravely concerned" over the
situation in Swat Valley, after an ICRC team reported problems with running
water, food, electricty and communications.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Swat need greater humanitarian protection and assistance
immediately," said Pascal Cuttat, head of the organisation's delegation in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Given what we have already seen on the ground, we are mobilising additional
resources, but safe and unimpeded access to the area remains essential for our
teams to deliver."

Iraq delays Kirkuk election report by a week: MP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Baghdad, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The final report on staging provincial elections in Iraq's disputed region of
Kirkuk has been delayed by another week because of disagreements among
commission members, an MP said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The commission on Sunday notified parliament speaker Iyad al-Samarrai that it
had not succeeded in reaching a compromise" acceptable to Kirkuk's Kurdish,
Turkmen and Arab communities, Mohammad Mahdi al-Bayati, a Turkmen member of the
commission, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Samarrai asked commission members "to continue their mission another week" and
said he will submit "his own suggestions for a solution," Bayati added.
</P>
<P>
Arabs and Turkmen oppose to any further extension beyond a week although the
Kurds have no objection, he said.
</P>
<P>
The commission should have delivered its report on elections in the province by
mid-April, but the deadline was put back to the end of May.
</P>
<P>
Oil-rich Kirkuk, 250 kilometres (150 miles) north of the capital, has a
population of around 900,000.
</P>
<P>
The Arab and Turkmen communities want seats on the provincial council to be
divided into three equal blocs, but the Kurds say they form the majority of the
population and want better representation.
</P>
<P>
Intercommunal tensions prevented the staging of provincial elections in Kirkuk
on January 31, when the rest of Iraq except the three Kurdish provinces voted
for new councils.
</P>
<P>
The national parliament in Baghdad, backed by the United Nations, set up a
commission to look for a solution.

Bulgarians protest at Polish mother in tug-of-love saga
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
sofia, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of Bulgarians protested Sunday outside the Polish embassy in Sofia to
voice their fury over a tug-of-love saga which saw an eight-year-old girl taken
back into the custody of her mother.
</P>
<P>
The crowd, numbering more than a thousand, denounced both Barbara Jadwigd, the
Polish mother of Nikoleta Vasilev, and embassy officials who helped her retrieve
the eight-year-old from her father's home in line with a court order.
</P>
<P>
Emotions have been running high since a report on the private Nova channel last
week showed how Jadwigd had dragged her sobbing daughter into an embassy car
outside her father's home in the southeastern Bulgarian town of Asenovgrad.
</P>
<P>
As Nikoleta screamed for help from her father and grandmother, her seven-year-
old brother Pavel managed to escape and is still missing.
</P>
<P>
Jadwigd had obtained custody rights in a court case after accusing the father,
Todor Vasilev, of kidnapping them from their home in Poland.
</P>
<P>
The father denied having taken the children to Bulgaria against their will, and
accused Jadwigd of being a poor parent.
</P>
<P>
Many Bulgarian politicians, including European Affairs Minister Gergana Passi,
have denounced the mother's behaviour while recognising the fact that a court
had indeed granted her the right to take them from the father.
</P>
<P>
The Polish embassy in Sofia meanwhile published a statement on its website
saying that it "regrets the fact that some media reports on this case are far
from objective ... and cause unnecessary emotions in the society that do not
contribute to solving the case."
</P>
<P>
"The Bulgarian court ruled at two instances that the children must be returned
to the place from which they were kidnapped, against the will and in the absence
of one of the parents," it added.

<P>
Atletico Madrid striker Diego Forlan won the 'pichichi' crown for the Spanish
league's top-scorer after finishing the season with 32 goals as his side
finished fourth to secure Champions League football.
</P>
<P>
Uruguayan international Forlan, 30, finishes two goals above long-time leader,
Barcelona's Samuel Eto'o, to lift his second pichichi title having won it in
Villarreal's colours in 2005.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy because we qualified for the Champions League for the second
consecutive year and because I won the pichichi in a very strong Spanish
league," said Forlan.
</P>
<P>
Forlan, a 21-million-euro signing from Villarreal in 2007, hit a real purple
patch scoring in eight consecutive games to top the charts and become the first
player to score 30 goals in a season since Brazilian great Ronaldo netted 34
goals with Barcelona in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The goalscoring exploits of the former Manchester United man have reportedly
attracted interest from several clubs but Forlan has insisted he is happy at
Atletico where he is contracted until 2011.

Football: Betis relegated after Osasuna, Sporting heroics
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MADRID, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Real Betis were relegated from the Spanish top-flight on a heart-breaking final
Sunday of the season, drawing 1-1 at home to Valladolid while relegation rivals
Osasuna and Sporting Gijon both won.
</P>
<P>
Betis started a point above the drop zone knowing a win would keep them in the
top tier but Sporting's 2-1 comeback win over Recreativo Huelva coupled with
Osasuna's sensational 2-1 victory against nine-man Real Madrid saw them
relegated with 42 points.
</P>
<P>
Betis, who are based in the southern city of Seville, were last relegated in
2000 but immediately won promotion the following season and have been in the
first division since 2001, finishing as high as fourth in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Getafe, who drew 1-1 with Racing Santander, also finished on 42 points but
stayed up on goal difference while Valladolid's draw at Betis was enough to keep
them safe.
</P>
<P>
It was particularly tough for Betis duo Sergio Garcia and Ricardo Oliveira, who
cost a combined 19 million euros after being relegated with Real Zaragoza last
season.
</P>
<P>
At half-time Sporting Gijon, trailing Recre 1-0, were set to be relegated but
came back to win 2-1 and secure their top-flight status.
</P>
<P>
Sporting had spent a decade in the second division before winning promotion last
season and defied the odds to stay up with Luis Moran scoring a dramatic winner.
</P>
<P>
Osasuna were third from bottom before kick off and fell behind against Real
Madrid when Gonzalo Higuain scored early on.
</P>
<P>
However, Jose Camacho's men battled back, equalising through Jaroslav Plasil
before Juanfran smashed a stunning volley past Iker Casillas to keep them in the
division.
</P>
<P>
Michel Salgado and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar were both sent off for Real, who crashed
to a fifth successive defeat.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Espanyol bid farewell to their Montjuic stadium in style with captain
Raul Tamudo scoring a hat-trick in a 3-0 win over 10-man Malaga.
</P>
<P>
Tamudo, the club's all-time top-scorer and an icon after spending his entire
career at Espanyol, scored twice in the first half and completed his treble with
a 56th-minute penalty to give the Montjuic the perfect send-off.
</P>
<P>
Espanyol's new Cornella-El Prat stadium looked destined to host second-division
football next season before the club produced a sensational late run to beat the
drop.
</P>
<P>
With 26 games played Espanyol were bottom of the table, seven points from
safety, but Argentine coach Mauricio Pochettino turned things around and a burst
of form saw the club win eight out of their ten final games.
</P>
<P>
Malaga coach Antonio Tapia confirmed that he would not be in charge of the club
next season, saying that the time was right to step down.
</P>
<P>
"I won't be coach next season," said Tapia. "After an excellent season I think
it is the ideal time for my family and I to end this chapter in my life."
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Sevilla defeated relegated Numancia 2-0 in a game with little at
stake.
</P>
<P>
Sevilla already had a Champions League spot wrapped up before the game and coach
Manolo Jimenez tested fringe players with next season in mind.
</P>
<P>
Jimenez was recently rewarded with a contract extension until 2010 after getting
Sevilla into the Champions League by finishing third and now has the task of
trying to close the gap on the top two of Barcelona and Real Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Numancia will prepare for life in the second division with the highlight of
their campaign a 1-0 victory over treble-winners Barcelona in Soria on the
opening day of the season.

Last Titanic survivor dies in England: BBC

<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Millvina Dean, the last remaining survivor of the sinking of the Titanic, died
Sunday at a care home in England, the BBC reported, citing two of her friends.
She was 97.
</P>
<P>
Dean was a two-month-old baby and her family were emigrating to Kansas in the
United States when the Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg in the Atlantic
Ocean on its maiden voyage in 1912.
</P>
<P>
She was placed in a sack and carried to safety. Her mother and brother also
survived, but her father was among the 1,500 passengers and crew who died.
</P>
<P>
Two of Dean's unnamed friends told the BBC that she died at the care home in
Hampshire, in southern England. She had spent most of her life in Southampton in
the county of Hampton, from where the Titanic set out.
</P>
<P>
Dean had been struggling to pay the bills for her care home and in October 2008
raised 31,150 pounds (40,000 euros, 53,900 dollars) by auctioning off items from
the liner.
</P>
<P>
She was forced to sell a 100-year-old suitcase filled with clothes which was
donated to her family by the people of New York when they arrived in the United
States after being rescued.
</P>
<P>
Rare prints of the liner signed by the artists along with compensation letters
sent to her mother by the Titanic Relief Fund also went under the hammer in
Devizes, southwest England.
</P>
<P>
The last remaining US survivor, Lillian Asplund, died in her home in May 2006 at
the age of 99. She was just five years old when the Titanic went down.

Football: Sad exit for Jose as Ahly stunned in Angola
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JOHANNESBURG, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manuel Jose ended his title-strewn career as Al-Ahly coach disastrously when the
Egyptian giants were dumped out of the African Confederation Cup by Santos in
Angola on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ahly, winners of the African Champions League a record six times, took a 3-0
lead into the return match and even the absence of star midfielder Mohamed
Aboutraika was not expected to prevent them reaching the group phase.
</P>
<P>
But a Santos team competing in Africa for the first time this year had other
ideas and triumphed 3-0 in Luanda to level the aggregate score before winning
the fourth-round tie 6-5 on penalties.
</P>
<P>
"It is unbelievable to be out of this competition and to have lost by three
goals today. My players have won so many trophies with me," a stunned Jose told
AFP at Coqueiros Stadium in the Angolan capital.
</P>
<P>
"But, at the same time, the team was tired as we have just finished the Egyptian
championship and we also had three players missing on national duty in Oman.
</P>
<P>
"I am sad to have ended my time at Ahly in this way, but I have fantastic
memories. I love and respect the club so much and it was the best time in my
life as a coach."
</P>
<P>
Among those who failed from the spot for Ahly was Angola-born striker Flavio
Amado, whose agent claims he is quitting the Cairo 'Red Devils' for a three-year
contract with Saudi Arabian outfit Al-Shabab.
</P>
<P>
Bebucho put the Angolans ahead mid-way through the first half, Milex set up a
thrilling finish with a second goal as the game entered the closing stages and
Saul struck the crucial third two minutes from full-time.
</P>
<P>
All the goals were brilliantly executed by a team who scored four goals each in
previous home encounters against USM of Gabon and Union Douala of Cameroon
having received a first round bye.
</P>
<P>
Bebucho strode forward before unleashing an unstoppable 30-metre shot past
goalkeeper Ramzi Saleh, Milex volleyed a loose ball into the net from close
range and Saul clinically sidefooted home a cross.
</P>
<P>
Success for Santos completed a wonderful weekend for the oil-rich southern
Africa nation in the second-tier African club competition, as Primeiro Agosto
eliminated holders CS Sfaxien in Tunisia on Saturday, also after a shootout.
</P>
<P>
Ahly have campaigned in Africa regularly since 1975 and this was only the fourth
time they had suffered a three-goal loss, with Mouloudia Alger of Algeria,
Hearts of Oak of Ghana and Al-Hilal of Sudan inflicting the other defeats.
</P>
<P>
The heavy reverses against Mouloudia and Hearts came three decades ago while
Hilal triumphed two years ago in Omdurman against a club that claims 40 million
supporters in Egypt and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
It was a sad exit for Jose, who stays in Luanda to take over a struggling
Angolan national team from June 1 with the task of building a team capable of
using home advantage to win the 2010 African Nations Cup.
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old Portuguese led Ahly to four of their six African Champions
League titles and many African media observers consider him the greatest foreign
coach to have worked at club level on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Primeiro lost 2-0 to Sfaxien only to convert all their post-match penalties and
win the shootout 5-4, while Stade Malien of Mali outplayed Al-Ittihad Khemisset
of Morocco 3-1 in Bamako to advance 4-2 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Another five ties in the final qualifying round will be decided later on Sunday
before the mini-league phase kicks off in mid-July.

Football: Injury forces Henry out of France friendlies
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barcelona striker Thierry Henry has been ruled out of France's forthcoming
friendly matches against Nigeria and Turkey due to a knee injury, France coach
Raymond Domenech revealed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
France have not yet decided to call up any replacements for the home games
against Nigeria on June 2 and Turkey three days later.
</P>
<P>
Henry, 31, played in Barcelona's 2-0 victory over Manchester United in the
Champions League final in Rome on Wednesday, having overcome a knee ligament
injury sustained in the Spanish champions' 6-2 thrashing of Real Madrid on May
2.
</P>
<P>
"I expected it a little bit," Domenech said on the French Football Federation
website on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It makes sense, Thierry didn't play for three weeks. He had to force himself to
play in the Champions League final. I understand that, I would have done the
same, anyone would have done the same, he didn't play at 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is that he recovers. It would achieve nothing for him
(to play against Nigeria and Turkey).
</P>
<P>
"I anticipated it. If we have 25 players in the squad, it's to manage the
situation. It was completely expected."
</P>
<P>
Speaking after Wednesday's game in Rome, Henry conceded that he had been forced
to play through the pain barrier.
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I didn't think I'd play, but on Tuesday evening I started to
believe that it would be OK," the former Arsenal, Juventus and Monaco forward
said.
</P>
<P>
"With (Andres) Iniesta (who had also been an injury doubt), we gritted our
teeth."

Cycling: Menchov wins Tour of Italy despite dramatic fall
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ROME, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russian rider Denis Menchov won the Tour of Italy here on Sunday despite
suffering a dramatic fall in the last kilometre of the final stage, a 14.4km
time-trial round.
</P>
<P>
The Rabobank cyclist, who is the third Russian to win the race, added the title
to his two Tour of Spain victories in 2005 and 2007.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old beat Italian 2007 champion Danilo Di Luca into second at 41sec
with his compatriot Franco Pellizzoti rounding off the podium finishers a
further 1min 18sec adrift.
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian Ignatas Konovalovas of the Cervelo team won the final stage in a time
of 18:42 with Briton Bradley Wiggins only a second back and Norway's Edvald
Boasson Hagen in third.
</P>
<P>
Menchov finished 10th on the stage with Di Luca 16th.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have time to think, it all happened so quickly," Menchov said of his
tumble. "In my earpiece I heard 'no risks, no risks'.
</P>
<P>
"My first move was to get the back back up, but it was too risky. Luckily the
mechanic, in a very professional way, already had another bike there for me.
</P>
<P>
"This win on the Giro is the biggest of my career. It gives me a lot of
confidence. I know I can win the Tour (de France)," he added.
</P>
<P>
Second-placed Di Luca said he had "nothing to regret. "I attacked each time I
could, whenever it was possible".
</P>
<P>
"I can take a lot away from this race: two stage wins, seven days in the pink
jersey, and the final points jersey. It's been the greatest race of my life."
</P>
<P>
The Russian had a 20sec lead coming into the final day in one of the closest
ever finishes to a Giro, in its centenary year.
</P>
<P>
Di Luca briefly looked to be on the brink of a famous victory when he got to the
first time-check fastest of all and 5sec up on Menchov.
</P>
<P>
But the LPR rider had blasted out too fast, gradually fading from there and he
was 14sec down on Menchov at the next time check.
</P>
<P>
When he came over the line, Di Luca had lost 45sec to Konovalovas whereas
Menchov, who had won the 12th stage time-trial to take over the pink jersey last
Thursday, was getting stronger.
</P>
<P>
The Russian looked like he may even win the final time-trial as well but with
rain spitting down drama unfolded in the final kilometre.
</P>
<P>
Riding in a straight line but on a cobbled section, Menchov suddenly crashed
with just 1km left to ride, but quick thinking from his mechanic may have
secured him the victory.
</P>
<P>
As Menchov was still sliding along the wet surface, his mechanic had already
jumped out of the team car and was unloading another bike from the roof.
</P>
<P>
Menchov went to pick up his splayed bike but received a shout from the mechanic
and instead jumped straight onto the new one and was back on his way, courtesy
of a push from the mechanic as well.
</P>
<P>
He had been going so well, though, that he still had time to spare on Di Luca
and despite the crash he gained a further 21sec on his rival.
</P>
<P>
Tour de France champion Carlos Sastre finished fourth and seven-time Tour winner
Lance Armstrong came in 12th.
</P>
<P>
Sastre said the race had left a "bitter-sweet taste".
</P>
<P>
"I came with an ambition different from what I achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I won two stages but I missed out on the podium. For three weeks we haven't had
a quiet stage. It's been a really tough course."

Rugby League: Huddersfield grab last gasp victory over Castleford
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Danny Kirmond's late try saw Huddersfield reach the Challenge Cup semi-finals on
Sunday as they beat Castleford 16-14.
</P>
<P>
Kirmond's 77th minute try completed a great comeback for the hosts.
</P>
<P>
Castleford had one foot in the semi-finals when Brett Ferres' converted try gave
them a 14-6 lead ten minutes after the break.
</P>
<P>
But the Giants hit back in the final 12 minutes through Stephen Wild before
Kirmond crossed to snatch the win.
</P>
<P>
Castleford had taken a fifth minute lead through Michael Shenton's try but Kevin
Brown's four-pointer, converted by former Wests full-back Brett Hodgson, made it
6-6 at the break.
</P>
<P>
Ferres and two goals from Kirk Dixon gave Cas a cushion but they were left
stunned at the death.
</P>
<P>
Huddersfield coach Nathan Brown hailed the Giants never-say-die attitude as they
sealed a semi-final clash with holders St Helens.
</P>
<P>
"It's a great result for the club but it was a frustrating performance for us at
times," said the former St George coach.
</P>
<P>
"We played poorly at times but the one thing we do is try pretty hard and
because we do that we give ourselves chances to win games at the end and
fortunately we did that this time.
</P>
<P>
"We came up with some key plays at the end and it's a real privilege to be in
the last four.
</P>
<P>
"Now we are in the last four we've got a great chance and for us to have come
this far we must be doing something right."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday Warrington stand-off Lee Briers dropped a golden-point drop-goal to
dump in-form Hull KR out of the Challenge Cup, 25-24.
</P>
<P>
In a desperate search for the winning points, Briers had already failed with
three drop goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
However, Briers refused to throw in the towel and finally succeeded on his
fourth attempt to send the Wolves into the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
The tense victory avenged Warrington's quarter-final defeat in 2006, when then
National League One side Rovers sprung a famous victory to secure a place in the
last four.
</P>
<P>
The nailbiting quarter-final went to golden point time after the clash finished
24-24 after 80 minutes, thanks to Michael Dobson's last-gasp penalty.
</P>
<P>
The home side took the lead inside three minutes when Paul Cooke's pass allowed
Peter Fox to send through Kris Welham under the posts.
</P>
<P>
The lead didn't last long as Warrington drew level thanks to Vinnie Anderson,
which saw the first-half finish all square.
</P>
<P>
Warrington took the lead after the break as Jon Clarke touched down but the
Robins bounced back with quick tries from ex-Newcastle Knights forward Clint
Newton, Ben Galea and Jake Webster.
</P>
<P>
The visitors regained their composure and reduced the deficit to four points
when Matt King touched down before Chris Bridge once again put the visitors in
front.
</P>
<P>
A Dobson penalty levelled the scores just before full-time, forcing the match
into a sudden-death golden-point thriller, until Briers' settled it.
</P>
<P>
St Helens eased into the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup with a thumping 12-try
66-6 victory over Gateshead.
</P>
<P>
The win also included Sean Long's 1,000th goal for the club, while former
Australia centre Matt Gidley and ex-Sydney Roosters second-row Chris Flannery
grabbed doubles for Saints.
</P>
<P>
Wigan moved to within a sight of a return to Wembley after an 11-year absence
with a 28-6 win over Salford.
</P>
<P>
Former Wests winger Pat Richards was the star of the show with a hat-trick of
tries and eight points with the boot.
</P>
<P>
In the weekend's only Super League fixture, Wakefield racked up a half century
of points against Celtic Crusaders, winning 50-6.
</P>
<P>
Wakefield ran in nine tries, with the game all but over at the break as Trinity
led by 30 points.
</P>
<P>
Trinity's tries came from Ryan Atkins, Michael Korkidas, Scott Grix, Danny
Brough and Brad Drew before the break, while Jamie Rooney went over twice,
before Steve Snitch and Drew, with his second, completed the rout.

Tennis: Safina powers on, Ivanovic heads home
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Top seed Dinara Safina won at a canter to reach the French Open quarter-finals
on Sunday but it will not be title-holder Ana Ivanovic she meets there after the
Serb lost 6-2, 6-3 to Victoria Azarenka
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Russian brushed aside the challenge of France's Aravane Rezai
6-1, 6-0 in a centre-court mis-match and has conceded just five games in four
matches.
</P>
<P>
Also through to the last eight was comeback queen Maria Sharapova who dug deep
for a fourth straight match to see off China's Li Na 6-4, 0-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
She will next go up against Slovakia's Dominika Cibulkova who had too much
movement about the court and allround ability for Agnes Szavay of Hungary
winning 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Azaranka's win over Ivanovic was no great surprise as she had won three titles
this year already while Ivanovic has been laid low with injury and poor form
which almost forced her to miss her title defence.
</P>
<P>
Two breaks of serve in the sixth and eighth games were enough to clinch the
first set for the Arizona-based player and when she went 4-0 up in the second it
was all but over.
</P>
<P>
With the crowd cheering for Ivanovic and jeering Azarenko, the Serb did manage
two breaks of her own after that, but she could not hold onto her own serve
allowing the Belarussian to close out the tie.
</P>
<P>
Azarenka said she had not been upset by the crowd clearly favouring her
opponent.
</P>
<P>
"It was expected because she was the champion, but I hope they will be little
bit more for me now," she said.
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time I have made the quarter-finals (of a Grand Slam) and it's a
big step for me.
</P>
<P>
"It will be tough against Safina because she has lost only one match on clay
this year and has been killing people, but I will be ready."
</P>
<P>
Ivanovic said she had been feeling unwell from the middle of the first set.
</P>
<P>
"I started really well and felt good, but after the third point of the fourth
game I started to feel dizzy and lost my balance. It was really hard after
that."
</P>
<P>
Safina's win over Rezai was the perfect result for her as she closes in on
winning a first Grand Slam title and proving to herself and her detractors that
she is a worthy world No.1.
</P>
<P>
But it was a poor advertisement for women's tennis as the stage-struck
Frenchwoman, who won her first tournament as a professional in Strasbourg
earlier this month, capitulated in just 53 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"Getting into the quarter-finals like this feels good," said Safina.
</P>
<P>
"I remember Australia (where she reached the final) this year and I don't know
how many hours I needed there so I am feeling good right now.
</P>
<P>
"Since I became number one (April 20) I am playing better and better."
</P>
<P>
Safina's quickfire win was her 18th win out of 19 matches on clay this season
and confirmed her status as favourite to win her first Grand Slam title.
</P>
<P>
Sharapova was taken the distance in her three earlier matches finding a way to
win each time, but she looked to be on the way out as her game fell apart
against Li after the Russian had won the first set.
</P>
<P>
All seemed lost for the former world No.1 after Li went a break up 4-2 in the
decider, only for Sharapova to suddenly turn on the power again and win the next
four games.
</P>
<P>
Cibulkova, at 1.61 metres one of the smallest players on the WTA circuit,
dominated the rallies against Szavay from the start of their match jumping out
into a 4-0 lead and never looking like being caught after that.
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to lose from now on in," the Slovak said.
</P>
<P>
"I was injured before Roland Garros (leg muscle) and didn't play the big
tournaments, so I was a bit afraid. But now it's amazing."

GM: 54 percent of bondholders approve Treasury plan
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Creditors holding about 54 percent of General's Motors bonds have approved a
restructuring plan proposed by the US Treasury, a spokesman for the bondholders
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 54 percent represented 975 institutions, a spokesman for the ad hoc
committee of bondholders, Elliot Sloane told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury had given the bondholders until the end of the day Saturday to
respond to its proposal to create a new company and shed assets that were
causing losses.
</P>
<P>
The creditors collectively would receive 10 percent of GM's stock in return for
their shares, and warrants, or options to buy stock, allowing them to acquire up
to an additional 15 percent of the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
If the options are exercised, they would control up to 25 percent of the "new
GM," while the Treasury would at least initially hold a 72.5 percent stake in
the company that emerges from a bankruptcy court reorganization.
</P>
<P>
Bondholders who rejected the plan account for about 46 percent of GM's bond
debt. They can contest it in court and try to get as much of what they are owed
as they can through the bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
The government has warned that they may end up with little or nothing if they
take that route.
</P>
<P>
Once the world's biggest auto company, General Motors was poised Sunday to file
for bankruptcy protection.

Berlusconi defends right to privacy after fresh revelations
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Rome, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi hit out at coverage of his private life
on Sunday, dismissing reports that he hosted a party featuring topless women as
an intolerable intrusion on his privacy.
</P>
<P>
"We have really hit rock-bottom with this intrusion into the private life of
everyone," Berlusconi said at a press conference where he was asked both about
reports that his estranged wife was having an affair and about photos from a
party which are subject to a court injunction.
</P>
<P>
Questioned about the hundreds of photos taken at his Sardinia villa reportedly
featuring topless young women attending private functions in the gardens there,
Berlusconi defended his move to block their publication.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can accept that from outside his house, a photographer can manage to
take photos of the interior of his house," he said at the press conference in
the southern town of Bari.
</P>
<P>
"These pictures go against any sense of private life. This right to a private
life and to confidentiality are fundamental liberties," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Il Corriere della Sera newspapers, the pictures showed girls in
bikinis or topless wandering in the garden or standing under open-air showers.
</P>
<P>
Other girls, dressed, were pictured at Berlusconi's side.
</P>
<P>
The photos came from a New Years Eve party at the villa. The teenager at the
centre of the row between Berlusconi and wife earlier this month, which led her
to file for divorce, attended the party, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi was also asked about a report in the daily newspaper Libero, in which
right-wing politician Daniela Santanche alleged that Berlusconi's wife, Veronica
Lario, had a "companion" -- naming the man in question.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi said he was annoyed to see that his family's private life was being
splashed over the front page of a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"I would like not to respond," said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Defending Berlusconi, Santanche said he had not wrecked anyone's family, but his
wife had had a companion for a long time.
</P>
<P>
"Berlusconi had tried everything to keep his family together," said Santanche,
the leader of the small Movement for Italy party.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month Lario announced she wanted a divorce, saying she had run out
of patience over Berlusconi's well-known penchant for pretty women.

Pro-president party ahead in South Ossetia vote: early results
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TSKHINVALI, Georgia, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A party strongly supportive of the leader of Georgia's breakaway region of South
Ossetia was well ahead in parliamentary elections Sunday, initial results
showed.
</P>
<P>
The apparent dominance of Yedinstvo (Unity) in the legislative elections should
allow president Eduard Kokoity to cement his grip on the mountainous rebel
region recognized as independent by Russia and Nicaragua alone.
</P>
<P>
Based on an initial count of almost 8.0 percent of the vote, South Ossetia's
central election commission said Unity had polled 58.62 percent while the
People's Party, also largely uncritical of Kokoity, won 20.35 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Communists were third with 14.6 percent of the vote. Final results were due
at 0600 GMT on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The elections were marked by the sidelining of the anti-Kokoity opposition amid
talk he wants a loyal parliamentary majority to push through an amendment
allowing him to run again for office when his second term lapses in 2011.

Tennis: Soderling ends Nadal's French Open reign
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rafael Nadal's four-year Roland Garros reign came to a sensational end at the
hands of feuding rival Robin Soderling on Sunday as the race for the 2009 title
was thrown wide open.
</P>
<P>
Nadal, bidding for a record fifth successive French Open crown, slumped to his
first ever defeat here after winning all of his 31 matches since his 2005 debut.
</P>
<P>
His 6-2, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) fourth round loss was made harder to swallow
as it came against a man he described as one of the most unpopular in the locker
room after an acrimonious Wimbledon clash in 2007.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a tragedy, I had to lose one day. I must accept my defeats with the
same level of calm that I accept my victories," said Nadal, who had routed
Soderling 6-1, 6-0 at the Rome Masters just a month ago.
</P>
<P>
"He didn't surprise me because I know how he plays and how dangerous he can be.
I didn't play my best. I played very short and I couldn't attack. I made it easy
for him."
</P>
<P>
Soderling, whose win meant that compatriot Bjorn Borg kept level on four
successive wins with Nadal, said he always thought he could prevail.
</P>
<P>
"It's the biggest challenge to play the best claycourt player in history," said
the 24-year-old.
</P>
<P>
"But I had to believe I had a chance or I may as well go home. If he thinks that
he made it easy for me then that's his choice. I would never say anything like
that."
</P>
<P>
Soderling, who has battled back from a serious wrist injury, sent down a massive
61 winners to Nadal's 33 as the champion, looking jaded after another marathon
claycourt season, struggled to get any meaningful foothold in the tie.
</P>
<P>
Nadal's first set loss was the first time he had dropped a set in the tournament
since the 2007 final against Roger Federer, ending a run of 32 in a row.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard was reeling from the outset as the 23rd seeded Soderling unleashed
a brutal power game based on big serving and pinpoint accuracy with one of the
event's most devastating forehands.
</P>
<P>
Soderling will now face Russian 10th seed Nikolay Davydenko, twice a semi-
finalist, who completed Spain's miserable day with a 6-2, 6-2, 6-4 win over
eighth seed Fernando Verdasco.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Andy Murray reached his first French Open quarter-final with a
convincing 7-5, 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 win over Croatia's Marin Cilic.
</P>
<P>
The ever-improving 22-year-old Murray looked in impressive physical condition
with a series of long, punishing rallies eventually telling on the 13th seeded
Cilic, the youngest man left in the draw.
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing well." said Murray, only the third British man to make the last
eight here in the Open era.
</P>
<P>
"You don't reach the French Open quarter-finals without playing well.
</P>
<P>
"I've had a good claycourt season. I reached the quarters in Monte Carlo and
Madrid and now the last eight here. It's better than previous years but I will
try to keep on improving."
</P>
<P>
Murray next meets Chilean 13th seed Fernando Gonzalez who revealed how an injury
signing autographs almost shattered his French Open campaign.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old, who outgunned Romania's Victor Hanescu 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 to reach
the quarter-finals for the third time, injured his ankle while signing photos
and tennis balls for fans at the Rome Masters in April.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he spent a month on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
"I was signing autographs and someone called me from the other side of the court
and when I ran over to them, I twisted my ankle," said Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
"I think I only managed to sign two and then I had to go back to the locker room
because my ankle was so painful."

Hundreds cheer Dalai Lama as he leaves Denmark

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dalai Lama left Copenhagen on Sunday under the cheers of an adoring throng
of hundreds bidding farewell to Tibet's spiritual leader, whose latest trip to
Europe has angered China again.
</P>
<P>
He shook the hands of supporters who had waited for him outside his hotel as he
headed to the airport to travel to Iceland, the second leg of a trip that will
also take him to the Netherlands and France.
</P>
<P>
"As usual my visit to Denmark and to other countries is mainly spiritual and
educational, not political," he told AFP.
</P>
<P>
China criticised the Dalai Lama's meeting with Prime Minister Lars Loekke
Rasmussen and other top Danish elected officials, saying it "severely harmed"
relations between China and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has also been angered by the decision by Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe to
meet the Buddhist monk and give him an honorary citizen award when he visits
France June 6 to 8.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama told AFP that he felt "a great honour" to be receiving the award.
</P>
<P>
Beijing accuses the Dalai Lama of seeking independence for Tibet from Chinese
rule and considers any official meeting with the leader as meddling in China's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama, who has lived in exile in India since fleeing Tibet after the
failure of an anti-Chinese uprising in 1949, says he just wants meaningful
autonomy for his Himalayan homeland.

Tennis: Defeat not tragedy as Nadal vows to bounce back
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dethroned French Open champion Rafael Nadal vowed to bounce back from his
stunning loss to Robin Soderling, which shattered his dreams of a record fifth
successive Roland Garros title.
</P>
<P>
The world number one insisted he'd be better and stronger in time for his
Wimbledon title defence in three weeks' time.
</P>
<P>
"It's the end of the road and I have to accept it," said the world number one,
who was beaten for the first time at Roland Garros following 31 wins in 31
matches since his 2005 debut which propelled him to super-stardom.
</P>
<P>
"I have to accept my defeat as I accept my victories - with calm. I have to keep
a cool head to try and analyze what I did wrong.
</P>
<P>
"I need to learn, and you learn more when you lose than when you win. I need to
work on those points on which I wasn't good, and from there try and do better
for my next tournament.
</P>
<P>
"So this is not a tragedy, losing here in Paris. It had to happen one day."
</P>
<P>
For Nadal, losing his proud record could not have come at the hands of the worst
possible opponent after he and Soderling, who are not on speaking terms, fell
out after an acrimonious Wimbledon defeat in 2007.
</P>
<P>
Nadal was irritated by the big Swede's on-court imitation of his habit of
pulling at the rear of his shorts while Soderling dismissed the criticisms as
"bullshit".
</P>
<P>
Nadal, who turns 23 on Wednesday, said he would not get too downcast about his
fourth round 6-2, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) defeat.
</P>
<P>
The first thing he will do is head to the swimming pool at his Mallorca home and
convince himself that one defeat has not suddenly made him a bad player
following a 12 months where he won Wimbledon, the Olympics and the Australian
Open.
</P>
<P>
"This is sport, and you can have victories or defeats. No one remembers defeats
in the long run. People remember victories," added the Spaniard.
</P>
<P>
"So I have to move forward. I have a little time to prepare for Wimbledon, but I
have to move forward and try and prepare the best I can."
</P>
<P>
Soderling, who had never got beyond the third round of a Grand Slam before this
French Open, insists his feud with Nadal is a thing of the past, but he simply
refused to be intimidated by the Spaniard.
</P>
<P>
"He's just another player on the tour. He's the best claycourt player of all
time, but he's just like someone else to me," said the Swede who goes on to
tackle two-time semi-finalist Nikolay Davydenko for a place in the last four.
</P>
<P>
Soderling believes that the time he spent out of action at the end of 2007 and
the start of 2008, nursing a wrist injury, may have proved a crucial part in his
victory on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I was a little bit lucky because it was my left wrist. I was off the tour for
maybe five or six months, but I practiced a lot of tennis," he explained.
</P>
<P>
"I practiced my slice and my forehand. I couldn't do anything except for my two
handed backhand. I used the time very well.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of just waiting for the wrist to heal, I did everything I could.  I was
working out three, four hours in the gym every day."
</P>
<P>
Soderling also paid tribute to compatriot and coach Magnus Norman who made the
2000 final here.
</P>
<P>
"He definitely helped me a lot. He was a great player. What I like is that I can
really ask him anything - 'Did you feel the same when you were playing?', 'How
did you feel?' I think that is really helping me."

Four killed in Yemen clashes
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Sanaa, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four Yemenis, including a policeman, were killed and 13 others wounded in two
days of clashes between police and anti-government protesters in southern Yemen,
medics and witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The deaths bring the toll of Yemenis killed since demonstrations broke out in
the south in late April to 16, including five security force members. The Sanaa
government has blamed the protests on southern separatists.
</P>
<P>
A policeman and a demonstrator were killed on Sunday in the village of Labouss
in the southern province of Lahij, while another demonstrator was wounded in
confrontations in the nearby village of al-Eind, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Protesters chanted slogans against the government, which is controlled by
northerners, and carried posters of Ali Nasser Mohammed, the former president of
South Yemen, which was united with North Yemen in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday, one Yemeni protester was killed and five others wounded in
clashes when police opened fire to disperse a demonstration in Dali, north of
the southern port of Aden, capital of the former South Yemen.
</P>
<P>
"One protester, Tufiq al-Jaadi, died while being operated on in hospital. He was
hit by a bullet," medical sources said.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said police exchanged fire with demonstrators carrying banners with
anti-government slogans.
</P>
<P>
Violence broke out again at the hospital as police tried to arrest a wounded
demonstrator, resulting in injuries to a policeman and a protester, witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration in Dali was in its second day.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, one protester was killed and five others wounded in a clash with
police in the village of Ashehir, in the southeastern region of Hadramawt,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The disturbance was triggered by demands to release locals arrested over earlier
protests against the government, they said.
</P>
<P>
Socialists who formerly ruled the south led a secession bid in 1994 that sparked
a two-month civil war before the uprising was crushed by northern forces loyal
to veteran President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
</P>
<P>
The president has warned against the risks of Yemen breaking up into "several
entities" amid trouble in the south over the past year, sparked by social
demands and charges of negligence in the impoverished state.
</P>
<P>
Saleh, speaking on Sunday during a visit to Riyadh, thanked northern neighbour
Saudi Arabia for its support for Yemeni unity.
</P>
<P>
In a statement reported by Saudi official news agency SPA, Saleh praised King
Abdullah for "his support for Yemen, its security, its stability and its unity
as well as his strong backing of Yemen's development efforts."
</P>
<P>
"A strong, safe and stable Yemen is in the interest of the Saudi kingdom" and
the other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Saleh said.
</P>
<P>
The GCC also comprises Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman and
Qatar.

Cycling: Giro result 'promising' for Tour de France, says Armstrong
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
rome, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong said his 12th-placed finish in
the Giro d'Italia, which ended on Sunday, was "promising" ahead of this year's
French test.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old American, who broke a collarbone in a crash on the Tour of
Castilla and Leon in March, and his Astana team had insisted that he had not
come into his first ever Tour of Italy looking for victory.
</P>
<P>
"I came in open-minded. I did not know what to expect, obviously because of the
crash in Castilla and Leon, the time off the bike and the trip over here,"
Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
"In my view it has been a hard three weeks. In the second half of the race I
showed that I was certainly getting better and I think we can take that away
from here. It is promising for June and July."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong dismissed expectations that he would have returned to the cycling
world with victories in the biggest events.
</P>
<P>
"I may have disappointed some fans and people in the press room expecting that I
immediately should start winning big races," he said.
</P>
<P>
"That is crazy. I am almost 38 years old. Both of my feet are firmly on the
ground. It's taken a lot of work up to this point but we might ride strong and
be in the front in July."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong added: "The style of racing in Italy is different, but I liked it.
</P>
<P>
"Despite some dangerous stages, it was a great race. The Giro del Centenario
brought us to the most beautiful places of the country. The people here are
enthusiastic."
</P>
<P>
Astana team manager Johan Bruyneel said he hoped the matter of some unpaid
salaries would be resolved so the team could go on and compete in the Tour of
Luxembourg, the Dauphine Libere, the Tour of Switzerland and the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
"I am hopeful and confident that we can ride those races," said Bruyneel. The
financial woes that left salaries unpaid are not completely resolved yet.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the team sponsors will meet the deadline for the bank guarantee and
the payments.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover the UCI (International Cycling Union) now wants more guarantees about
the team for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
"The UCI will decide soon about the near future of the team. We hope to know
more in the coming days. The best solution is that we can continue with our
current structure. I expect that we will have a team at the start of the Tour de
France."

Football: Sad exit for Jose as Ahly stunned in Angola
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JOHANNESBURG, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manuel Jose ended his title-strewn career as Al-Ahly coach disastrously when the
Egyptian giants were dumped out of the African Confederation Cup by Santos in
Angola on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ahly, winners of the African Champions League a record six times, took a 3-0
lead into the return match and even the absence of star midfielder Mohamed
Aboutraika was not expected to prevent them reaching the group phase.
</P>
<P>
But a Santos team competing in Africa for the first time this year had other
ideas and triumphed 3-0 in Luanda to level the aggregate score before winning
the fourth-round tie 6-5 on penalties.
</P>
<P>
Among those who failed from the spot for Ahly was Angola-born striker Flavio
Amado, whose agent claims he is quitting the Cairo 'Red Devils' for a three-year
contract with Saudi Arabian outfit Shabab.
</P>
<P>
Bebucho put the Angolans ahead mid-way through the first half, Milex set up a
thrilling finish with a second goal as the game entered the closing stages and
Saul struck the crucial third two minutes from full-time.
</P>
<P>
All the goals were brilliantly executed by a team who scored four goals each in
previous home encounters against USM of Gabon and Union Douala of Cameroon
having received a first round bye.
</P>
<P>
Bebucho strode forward before unleashing an unstoppable 30-metre shot past
goalkeeper Ramzi Saleh, Milex volleyed a loose ball into the net from close
range and Saul clinically sidefooted home a cross.
</P>
<P>
Success for Santos completed a wonderful weekend for the oil-rich southern
Africa nation in the second-tier African club competition, as Primeiro Agosto
eliminated holders CS Sfaxien in Tunisia on Saturday, also after a shootout.
</P>
<P>
Ahly have campaigned in Africa regularly since 1975 and this was only the fourth
time they had suffered a three-goal loss, with Mouloudia Alger of Algeria,
Hearts of Oak of Ghana and Al-Hilal of Sudan inflicting the other defeats.
</P>
<P>
The heavy reverses against Mouloudia and Hearts came three decades ago while
Hilal triumphed two years ago in Omdurman against a club that claims 40 million
supporters in Egypt and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
It was a sad exit for Jose, who stays in Luanda to take over a struggling
Angolan national team from June 1 with the task of building a team capable of
using home advantage to win the 2010 African Nations Cup.
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old Portuguese led Ahly to four of their six African Champions
League titles and many African media observers consider him the greatest foreign
coach to have worked at club level on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Primeiro lost 2-0 to Sfaxien only to convert all their post-match penalties and
win the shootout 5-4, while Stade Malien of Mali outplayed Al-Ittihad Khemisset
of Morocco 3-1 in Bamako to advance 4-2 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Another five ties in the final qualifying round will be decided later on Sunday
before the mini-league phase kicks off in mid-July.

Abortion doctor shot dead at his Kansas church
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WICHITA, Kansas, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A controversial provider of late-term abortions was shot to death Sunday as he
walked into services at his Kansas church, officials said.
</P>
<P>
A lightning rod in the bitter culture war over abortion, George Tiller had
already been picketed, bombed and shot in the arms.
</P>
<P>
He was shot to death just after 10 am (1500 GMT) in the lobby of Reformation
Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kansas, police and city officials said.
</P>
<P>
A white man wielding a handgun shot Tiller, 67, and then fled in a powder blue
Ford Taurus.
</P>
<P>
"It's an unfortunate incident to happen on a Sunday morning," Wichita police
captain Brent Allred told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"These things should not occur at a any time."
</P>
<P>
The FBI and state police were called in to help search for the shooter, whose
license plate was registered to a home in a suburb of Kansas City, some 200
miles away on the border with Missouri.
</P>
<P>
The shooting came just two weeks after President Barack Obama sought "common
ground" over the divisive abortion debate in a controversial speech at one of
the top Catholic universities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The president has attempted to defuse one of the most emotive issues in US
public life by arguing that while abortion should remain legal, the government
should do all it can to limit unwanted pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
But Obama has angered the anti-abortion movement by reversing predecessor George
W. Bush's restrictions on federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research and
for family-planning groups that carry out or facilitate abortions overseas.
</P>
<P>
Obama's choice for health secretary, former Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius,
has been widely condemned by the anti-abortion movement because of her ties to
Tiller.
</P>
<P>
Tiller, one of the few doctors who still performs late-term abortions in the
United States, has been demonized by abortion opponents who regularly protested
outside his clinic.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, someone placed a bomb on the roof of the clinic, seriously damaging the
building.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Tiller was shot in both arms outside the clinic. Tiller recovered, and
his assailant received an 11-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 protesters were also arrested outside the clinic during summer-long
demonstrations in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He was acquitted in March on charges that he performed 19 illegal abortions in
2003 in a case which his lawyer described as a witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
Tiller testified during the trial that he spent years under the protection of
federal agents after the FBI discovered an anti-abortion assassination list in
1994 that listed Tiller as the top target.
</P>
<P>
Tiller also testified that he owns one of only three clinics in the United
States that perform late-term abortions, which are performed on fetuses that
would be viable outside the mother's womb.
</P>
<P>
Late-term abortions are legal in Kansas if two independent physicians agree that
the mother could suffer irreparable harm by giving birth.
</P>
<P>
Tiller was acquitted of having an illegal financial relationship with the doctor
who provided the second opinion.

GM poised for bankruptcy as Treasury readies rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The US Treasury put the final touches Sunday on a plan to restructure General
Motors, once the world's largest automaker and now expected to join rival
Chrysler in filing for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
Monday will be a historic day for the US automobile industry. GM's new chief
executive, Fritz Henderson, has scheduled a news conference for the middle of
the day in New York, where the number one US automaker would file for
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The administration of President Barack Obama has given GM until June 1 to
present a viable restructuring plan, in return for government aid.
</P>
<P>
The rescue could reach 60 billion dollars with the state taking a 72.5 per cent
ownership stake in the 101 year old company. Canada, which has several GM
factories, also will be digging into its pockets.
</P>
<P>
According to The New York Times, holders of GM's secured bonds agreed by a small
majority on Saturday to a new Treasury rescue plan that would give them 25
percent of the company. Washington had warned that if the plan were rejected,
creditors risked losing everything.
</P>
<P>
Among the backers was a committee of large investors holding about 20 percent of
GM's 27.2 billion dollars in outstanding bonds, The Times said.
</P>
<P>
No official announcement of the vote tally has yet been made.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the bondholders would obtain the rights to buy an extra 15
percent of GM's stock at a low price. They would also control 25 percent of the
new GM, after having supported the new company's creation in bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
The New York bankruptcy court also is expected to rule Monday on number three US
automaker Chrysler, which filed for bankruptcy protection a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Under an expedited process, judge Arthur Gonzales was expected to approve the
creation of a new Chrysler, called 'New Carco,' which would preserve the
automaker's healthiest assets and liquidate the rest.
</P>
<P>
The new entity will be controlled by a consortium consisting of the Italian
automaker Fiat, the United Auto Workers union, and the US and Canadian
governments.
</P>
<P>
Fiat will have a 20 percent stake with the option to increase it to 35 percent;
the UAW 55 percent; and the US and Canadian governments 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The automakers fate, the subject of debate on television talks shows, is being
closely watched in US political and economic circles.
</P>
<P>
"This is a real sad day," said former Republican presidential contender Mitt
Romney.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a son of Detroit. My dad was an auto executive. You know, I drive American
cars. I love American cars. My heart bleeds for the people in Michigan and
Detroit, for all these auto workers," he said on Fox News.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, GM had 244,000 employees around the world, about half
of them in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Mitch McConnell, the senate minority leader, called the auto rescue plan "a big
mistake," arguing that the government had done too much to keep GM and Chyrsler
out of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNN, he held up the example of Ford, the number two US
automaker, as "an American company that hasn't taken government money and is
still producing automobiles."
</P>
<P>
Corporate leaders, meanwhile, urged the government not to overstay its welcome
in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
"I think all of us understand the need for the government to intervene and take
the actions they did," said Anne Mulcahy, chief executive of Xerox. "But I also
think there's a need for an exit plan."
</P>
<P>
The possibility of bankruptcy for such an iconic American company has been
viewed with great foreboding in a country where the automobile is deeply
embedded in the national imagination.
</P>
<P>
"The phrase 'bankrupt General Motors,' which we expect to hear uttered on Monay,
leaves Americans my age in economic shock," the writer PJ O'Rourke said in the
Wall Street Journal. "The words are as melodramatic as 'Mom's nude photos.'"

Cycling: Menchov wins Tour of Italy despite dramatic fall
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ROME, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russian rider Denis Menchov won the Tour of Italy here on Sunday despite
suffering a dramatic fall in the last kilometre of the final stage, a 14.4km
time-trial round.
</P>
<P>
The Rabobank cyclist, who is the third Russian to win the race, added the title
to his two Tour of Spain victories in 2005 and 2007.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old beat Italian 2007 champion Danilo Di Luca into second at 41sec
with his compatriot Franco Pellizzoti rounding off the podium finishers a
further 1min 18sec adrift.
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian Ignatas Konovalovas of the Cervelo team won the final stage in a time
of 18:42 with Briton Bradley Wiggins only a second back and Norway's Edvald
Boasson Hagen in third.
</P>
<P>
Menchov finished 10th on the stage with Di Luca 16th.
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to regret," said Di Luca. "I attacked each time I could,
whenever it was possible.
</P>
<P>
"I can take a lot away from this race: two stage wins, seven days in the pink
jersey, and the final points jersey. It's been the greatest race of my life."
</P>
<P>
The Russian had a 20sec lead coming into the final day in one of the closest
ever finishes to a Giro, in its centenary year.
</P>
<P>
Di Luca briefly looked to be on the brink of a famous victory when he got to the
first time-check fastest of all and 5sec up on Menchov.
</P>
<P>
But the LPR rider had blasted out too fast, gradually fading from there and he
was 14sec down on Menchov at the next time check.
</P>
<P>
When he came over the line, Di Luca had lost 45sec to Konovalovas whereas
Menchov, who had won the 12th stage time-trial to take over the pink jersey last
Thursday, was getting stronger.
</P>
<P>
The Russian looked like he may even win the final time-trial as well but with
rain spitting down drama unfolded in the final kilometre.
</P>
<P>
Riding in a straight line but on a cobbled section, Menchov suddenly crashed
with just 1km left to ride, but quick thinking from his mechanic may have
secured him the victory.
</P>
<P>
As Menchov was still sliding along the wet surface, his mechanic had already
jumped out of the team car and was unloading another bike from the roof.
</P>
<P>
Menchov went to pick up his splayed bike but received a shout from the mechanic
and instead jumped straight onto the new one and was back on his way, courtesy
of a push from the mechanic as well.
</P>
<P>
He had been going so well, though, that he still had time to spare on Di Luca
and despite the crash he gained a further 21sec on his rival.
</P>
<P>
Tour de France champion Carlos Sastre finished fourth and seven-time Tour winner
Lance Armstrong came in 12th.
</P>
<P>
Sastre said the race had left a "bitter-sweet taste".
</P>
<P>
"I came with an ambition different from what I achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I won two stages but I missed out on the podium. For three weeks we haven't had
a quiet stage. It's been a really tough course."

Yemen to inaugurate first LNG plant
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SANAA, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yemen will inaugurate its first liquefied natural gas plant next month and begin
exporting in August with the first shipment destined for South Korea, the oil
minister said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The plant at Balhaf on the south coast is ready "for its official inauguration
on June 16, and the export of its first shipment of gas to South Korea will come
eight weeks later," Oil Minister Amir Salem al-Aydarus said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to South Korea, LNG from Yemen will also be exported to Europe and
north America, the minister said in a statement posted online on the defence
ministry's website, 26Sep.net.
</P>
<P>
Yemen has already taken delivery of two of four LNG tankers on order, the
statement said, quoting Aydarus as saying the remaining two ships will be
delivered "in the coming days."
</P>
<P>
A tanker carrying the first shipment of 120,000 cubic metres (more than four
million cubic feet) of LNG will sail for South Korea in August.
</P>
<P>
The maiden cargo of gas will mark the culmination of a project launched in
October 2005 at a total cost of four billion dollars, making it the largest ever
project in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
The LNG project is vital to the economic future of Yemen, where oil revenues
currently make up 70 percent of state revenue.
</P>
<P>
When a second liquefying unit becomes operational towards the end of the year
Yemen will be able to export 6.7 million tonnes of gas annually -- equivalent to
180,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
It will remain a small player on the LNG market nevertheless, with reserves of
259 billion cubic metres.
</P>
<P>
Yemen is one of the poorest countries on Earth despite its proximity to oil
powerhouse Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Its own oil exports are tiny compared with its northern neighbour. Last year it
produced less than 300,000 bpd of crude oil, and production is decreasing by
five to six percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs Abdulkarim Ismail al-Arhabi told AFP
in March that he expects the country's modest oil reserves to be exhausted by
2020.
</P>
<P>
"Gas will make up for the decrease in oil production," he said.

Rafael Nadal's four-year Roland Garros reign came to a sensational end at the

was thrown wide open.
</P>

Nadal, bidding for a record fifth successive French Open crown, slumped to his
first ever defeat here after winning all of his 31 matches since his 2005 debut.
</P>
<P>
His 6-2, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) fourth round loss was made harder to swallow
as it came against a man he described as one of the most unpopular in the locker
room after an acrimonious Wimbledon clash in 2007.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a tragedy, I had to lose one day. I must accept my defeats with the
same level of calm that I accept my victories," said Nadal, who had routed
Soderling 6-1, 6-0 at the Rome Masters just a month ago.
</P>
<P>
"He didn't surprise me because I know how he plays and how dangerous he can be.
I didn't play my best. I played very short and I couldn't attack. I made it easy
for him to play at his level."
</P>
<P>
Soderling, whose win meant that compatriot Bjorn Borg kept level on four
successive wins with Nadal, said he always thought he could win.
</P>
<P>
"It's the biggest challenge to play the best claycourt player in history," said
the 24-year-old.
</P>
<P>
"But I had to believe I had a chance or I may as well go home. But if he thinks
that he made it easy for me then that's his choice. I would never say anything
like that."
</P>
<P>
Soderling, who has battled back from a serious wrist injury, sent down a massive
61 winners to Nadal's 33 as the champion, looking jaded after another marathon
claycourt season, struggled to get any meaningful foothold in the tie.
</P>
<P>
Nadal's first set loss was the first time he had dropped a set in the tournament
since the 2007 final against Roger Federer, ending a run of 32 in a row.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard was reeling from the outset as the 23rd seeded Soderling unleashed
a brutal power game based on big serving and pinpoint accuracy with one of the
event's most devastating forehands.
</P>
<P>
The Swede's sensational victory, which will now boost Roger Federer's lifetime
dream of adding an elusive French Open to his 13-title Grand Slam collection,
overshadowed Sunday's three other last 16 ties.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Andy Murray reached his first French Open quarter-final with a
convincing 7-5, 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 win over Croatia's Marin Cilic.
</P>
<P>
The ever-improving 22-year-old Murray looked in impressive physical condition
with a series of long, punishing rallies eventually telling on the 13th seeded
Cilic, the youngest man left in the draw.
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing well." said Murray, only the third British man to make the last
eight here in the Open era.
</P>
<P>
"You don't reach the French Open quarter-finals without playing well.
</P>
<P>
"I've had a good claycourt season. I reached the quarters in Monte Carlo and
Madrid and now the last eight here. It's better than previous years but I will
try to keep on improving."
</P>
<P>
Murray next meets Chilean 13th seed Fernando Gonzalez who revealed how an injury
signing autographs almost shattered his French Open campaign.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old, who outgunned Romania's Victor Hanescu 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 to reach
the quarter-finals for the third time, injured his ankle while signing photos
and tennis balls for fans at the Rome Masters in April.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he spent a month on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
"I was signing autographs and someone called me from the other side of the court
and when I ran over to them, I twisted my ankle," said Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
"I think I only managed to sign two and then I had to go back to the locker room
because my ankle was so painful."
</P>
<P>
In the day's other last 16 tie, Russian 10th seed Nikolay Davydenko, twice a
semi-finalist, faces Spanish eighth seed Fernando Verdasco who is looking for a
first quarter-final place.
</P>
<P>
The winner will tackle Soderling for a place in the semi-finals.

Britain to fight lawsuit from US shock-jock
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The British government said Sunday it would fight any legal action brought by
right-wing US radio host Michael Savage after he was barred from entering the
country for "unacceptable behaviour".
</P>
<P>
Savage has threatened to sue Home Secretary Jacqui Smith for defamation after he
was named on a list she announced this month of 16 banned individuals, which
included a Hamas lawmaker, anti-gay protesters and a Jewish extremist.
</P>
<P>
The Mail on Sunday reported that Savage, whose real name is Michael Alan Weiner,
was planning to sue for 100,000 pounds (160,000 dollars, 115,000 euros) and had
instructed London-based solicitors Olswang to begin proceedings.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the lawyers have written to Smith and demanded she
retract the allegations and make a personal apology.
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for the Home Office said it would not back down.
</P>
<P>
"He was excluded for engaging in unacceptable behaviour by making comments that
might provoke others to serious criminal acts and foster hatred that might lead
to inter-community violence," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Any legal proceedings would be robustly defended; we stand by our decision to
exclude this individual.
</P>
<P>
"Coming to the UK is a privilege that we refuse to extend to those who abuse our
standards and values to undermine our way of life."
</P>
<P>
Savage has been accused of racism and homophobia and once wished that a critical
caller would die of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
However, an appeal for donations to support his legal challenge posted on his
website insists he has never advocated violence.
</P>
<P>
"He has repeatedly called for the lawful enforcement of America’s borders,
language, and culture. He has never advocated violence, or he would not have
lasted in radio for 15 minutes, let alone 15 years," the appeal says.

Football: Sad exit for Jose as Ahly stunned in Angola
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Johannesburg, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manuel Jose ended his title-strewn career as Al-Ahly coach disastrously when the
Egyptian giants were dumped out of the African Confederation Cup by Santos in
Angola on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ahly, winners of the African Champions League a record six times, took a 3-0
lead into the return match and even the absence of star midfielder Mohamed
Aboutraika was not expected to prevent them reaching the group phase.
</P>
<P>
But a Santos team competing in Africa for the first time this year had other
ideas and triumphed 3-0 in Luanda to level the aggregate score before winning
the fourth-round tie 6-5 on penalties.
</P>
<P>
Bebucho put the Angolans ahead mid-way through the first half, Milex set up a
thrilling finish with a second goal as the game entered the closing stages and
Saul struck the crucial third two minutes from full-time.
</P>
<P>
Success for Santos completed a wonderful weekend for the oil-rich southern
Africa nation in the second-tier African club competition, as Primeiro Agosto
eliminated holders CS Sfaxien in Tunisia on Saturday, also after a shootout.
</P>
<P>
Ahly have campaigned in Africa regularly since 1975 and this was only the fourth
time they had suffered a three-goal loss, with Mouloudia Alger of Algeria,
Hearts of Oak of Ghana and Al-Hilal of Sudan inflicting the other defeats.
</P>
<P>
The heavy reverses against Mouloudia and Hearts came three decades ago while
Hilal triumphed two years ago in Omdurman against a club that claims 40 million
supporters in Egypt and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
It was a sad exit for Jose, who stays in Luanda to take over a struggling
Angolan national team from June 1 with the task of building a team capable of
using home advantage to win the 2010 African Nations Cup.
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old Portuguese led Ahly to four of their six African Champions
League titles and many African media observers consider him the greatest foreign
coach to have worked at club level on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Primeiro lost 2-0 to Sfaxien only to convert all their post-match penalties and
win the shootout 5-4, while Stade Malien of Mali outplayed Al-Ittihad Khemisset
of Morocco 3-1 in Bamako to advance 4-2 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Another five ties in the final qualifying round will be decided later on Sunday
before the mini-league phase kicks off in mid-July.

Nigeria troops destroy militant camp: spokesman
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LAGOS, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nigeria's army said Sunday it had destroyed a militants' camp in southern Rivers
state as part of their campaign to put a halt to a campaign of unrest and
hostage-takings in the oil-rich region.
</P>
<P>
"The troops of Joint Task Force (JTF) have located and destroyed a militants'
camp close to Buguma creek in Rivers State after a fierce exchange of fire with
the militants," army spokesman Rabe Abubakar said.
</P>
<P>
"The troops of JTF were fired at from the militants’ camp over night and the
security outfit has no choice but to locate and destroy the camp," he said in an
e-mail to AFP.
</P>
<P>
He said the military would get "rid of the criminals who are bent on causing
unnecessary tension and apprehension in the region".
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said the military also recovered some arms and ammunition during the
raid.
</P>
<P>
Several camps operated by militants have been destroyed since May 13 when
federal troops launched their operation against fighters of the Movement for the
Emancipation of Niger Delta (MEND).
</P>
<P>
In the past three and a half years MEND, which says it is fighting to ensure
local people have a greater share in the oil wealth, has been behind a series of
kidnappings of staff and attacks on oil installations in the region.
</P>
<P>
Violence in the Niger Delta has reduced Nigeria's daily output to 1.76 million
barrels compared with 2.6 million barrels in January 2006.

Armenia opposition pins hopes on Yerevan poll
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
YEREVAN, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of the Armenian capital voted in a municipal election Sunday in which
the main opposition movement is seeking to gain an important foothold on power
after losing political ground last year.
</P>
<P>
The Armenian National Congress is hoping it can win enough seats on the 65-seat
Yerevan city council for its leader -- former president Levon Ter-Petrosian --
to be elected mayor.
</P>
<P>
The vote has raised fears of a repeat of the violence after last year's
presidential elections that saw 10 people killed in clashes between riot police
and opposition supporters.
</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrosian and his backers accused the authorities of rigging the vote to
guarantee a win for President Serzh Sarkisian, who defeated Ter-Petrosian.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say it is likely the opposition will hold protests if it loses again,
risking another confrontation.
</P>
<P>
"The municipal elections are the first stage of ridding the country of this
criminal regime," said 29-year-old voter Astkhik Petrosian. "I voted for the
opposition. Once they have taken power in the city we will be able to have new
early presidential elections."
</P>
<P>
Polls opened at 8:00 am (0400 GMT) and closed 12 hours later, with final voter
turnout at about 53 percent, the Central Election Commission said.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results are to be announced within 24 hours after the vote and the
final results during the next seven days.
</P>
<P>
The city council will chose the mayor under constitutional amendments adopted in
2005. Armenia's president previously made the appointment for the four-year
term.
</P>
<P>
If any party wins 40 percent of the seats, its candidate becomes the city mayor,
otherwise the mayor is to be elected by the city council.
</P>
<P>
Yerevan's current mayor, Gagik Beglarian, is topping the ruling Republican
party's list in the municipal vote and opinion polls showed him leading.
</P>
<P>
"Beglarian has done a lot as mayor. It is easy to see that the city has become
more beautiful and orderly, that the city has changed for the better. So I voted
for the Republican party," said 43-year-old voter Sarkis.
</P>
<P>
Beglarian told journalists Sunday the vote was proceeding smoothly.
</P>
<P>
"No violations have been observed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrosian's party, however, said its activists had observed dozens of
violations on voting day, including voting by non-residents of the capital,
multiple ballot-casting and intimidation of opposition journalists.
</P>
<P>
The international community will be watching the vote to see if Armenia is
keeping its commitments on democratic reforms. An observers' delegation,
including Council of Europe and European Union representatives, is to make a
statement on the conduct of the vote Monday.

Mauritania coup chief campaigns as talks mull vote delay
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NOUAKCHOTT, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The head of last year's coup in Mauritania began a final push for votes Sunday
in the week before scheduled elections as his aides took part in talks about a
possible delay to the polls.
</P>
<P>
On a trip to the north, General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz pledged to improve
living standards in the poverty-stricken nation if he returns to power after the
scheduled June 6 ballot which he is widely expected to win.
</P>
<P>
But with the main opposition dismissing next weekend's polls as little more than
a sham, much of the attention was focused on neighbouring Senegal where
international mediators are convening talks aimed at resolving the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
According to the state news agency, Aziz pledged during a campaign apperarance
in the northern Atar region to work to bring about "an improvement in living
standards for every citizen, in particular the most vulnerable".
</P>
<P>
Aziz also promised to upgrade facilities in all the country's hospitals.
</P>
<P>
But while Aziz denounced talk of a delay in the polls over the weekend as
"rumours and lies", a source close to the opposition said that the talks in
Dakar were focusing on a proposal to delay the first round of the elections
until July 21 with the second round taking place on August 4.
</P>
<P>
A draft accord being discussed in the Senegalese capital Dakar would also see
Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, who was toppled in last August's coup, formally resign as
president after signing a decree to usher in a transitional period under a
temporary government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
The intensive talks began in Dakar last Thursday and resumed on Sunday morning
with Senegal's Foreign Minister Cheikh Tidiane Gadio saying he was convinced
that the talks would end with an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The African Union Commissioner for Peace and Security Ramtane Lamara, the United
Nations special representative for West Africa Said Djinnit and the US and
French ambassadors to Senegal are also participating in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Ould Abdel Aziz initially took power in the northwest African nation in August
last year as head of a military junta which toppled Cheikh Abdallahi, the
country's first democratically elected president.
</P>
<P>
He then quit the military in April to run for president in a move widely seen as
a ploy to legitimise the coup. The former junta chief is running against only
three other marginal candidates who have all supported the coup.

Cricket: Smith looks to cap Test success with T20 triumph
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Africa captain Graeme Smith believes winning the ICC World Twenty20 in
England will be the ideal way to show his side are a force to be reckoned with
in all forms of the game.
</P>
<P>
Smith has led his side to Test series wins in England and Australia in recent
times and now the opening batsman is looking for fresh success on English soil
as South Africa seek a first major one-day trophy since 1998.
</P>
<P>
"It would be lovely if we could be successful in this tournament or any ICC
tournament that is coming up," Smith told reporters at Lord's here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We have had an incredible period in the last 16 months and the team has
achieved so much.
</P>
<P>
"The confidence is good and we are excited about playing this tournament with
the chance to go out and express ourselves. I think there is a lot more talent,
flair and confidence among this team than ever before."
</P>
<P>
Smith and several of his compatriots had the ideal preparation for the World
Twenty20 by taking part in the 20-overs-per-side Indian Premier League.
</P>
<P>
A franchise event featuring many of the world's leading players, the IPL was
moved to South Africa at short notice after security fears meant it could not be
played in India.
</P>
<P>
"Cricket South Africa and the country as a whole did a fantastic job in hosting
the event at three weeks' notice," said Smith.
</P>
<P>
"It was an incredible effort and we proved our country’s ability at hosting
major events. A lot of our players had prominent roles in a number of the teams
which probably wouldn’t have happened if it had been in India and they had
good leadership roles among their teams."
</P>
<P>
Veteran all-rounder Jacques Kallis helped the Bangalore Royal Challengers to the
IPL final.
</P>
<P>
He has, though, sometimes been criticised for slow scoring and an unwillingness
to bowl his sharp seamers and Smith said: "Jacques is the one player who arrives
here with a point to prove.
</P>
<P>
"He had a decent performance in the IPL so his confidence his high and
tactically how we use him is important. He’s an all-rounder and needs to
contribute in all forms."
</P>
<P>
For many South African players, the combination of international and IPL
commitments has led to a fairly intense schedule.
</P>
<P>
"Mental fatigue is probably our biggest challenge and something we have
addressed as a team," Smith, whose side are in Group D alongside New Zealand and
minnows Scotland, said.
</P>
<P>
That professionalism wasn't matched, in Smith's eyes, on Sunday when the Proteas
turned up at the Southgate club ground in north London, used by Middlesex for
home matches when they are not at Lord's, for a practice session only to
discover that their arrival was news to their hosts.
</P>
<P>
They had to head back to Lord's instead and Smith said: "Even today with the
not-so-great training facilities we have had all over the place the guys have
still applied themselves."

<TEXT>
<P>
Espanyol bid farewell to their Montjuic stadium in style with captain Raul
Tamudo scoring a hat-trick in a 3-0 win over 10-man Malaga on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tamudo, the club's all-time top-scorer and an icon after spending his entire
career at Espanyol, scored twice in the first half and completed his treble with
a 56th minute penalty to give the Montjuic the perfect send-off.
</P>
<P>
Espanyol fans probably thought they would be struggling to fill their new
Cornella-El Prat stadium in the second division but the club produced a
sensational late run to beat the drop.
</P>
<P>
With 26 games gone Espanyol were bottom of the table, seven points from safety,
but Argentine coach Mauricio Pochettino turned things around and an incredible
run saw the club win eight out of the final ten games.
</P>
<P>
Promoted Malaga, reduced to ten men after the sending off of Weligton on 54
minutes, finish a respectable eighth and can be proud of a season when they
knocked on Europe's door, briefly flirting with the Champions League spots.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's other early match Sevilla defeated relegated Numancia 2-0 in a game
with little at stake.
</P>
<P>
Sevilla already had a Champions League spot wrapped up before the game and coach
Manolo Jimenez tested fringe players with next season in mind.
</P>
<P>
Jimenez was recently rewarded with a contract extension until 2010 after getting
Sevilla into the Champions League with third place and now has the task of
trying to close the gap on the top two of Barcelona and Real Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Numancia prepare for life in the second division with the highlight of their
campaign the memories of beating treble winners Barcelona 1-0 in Soria on the
opening day of the season.
</P>
<P>
Later on Sunday five teams fight to stay in the division in a tense relegation
finale.
</P>
<P>
Numancia and Recreativo Huelva are already down leaving one unwanted spot left
to fill.
</P>
<P>
Osasuna currently occupy third from bottom and must defeat Real Madrid, who have
lost their last four games, in Pamplona to guarantee their safety.
</P>
<P>
Sporting Gijon are level on 40 points with Osasuna and face already relegated
Recreativo at home.
</P>
<P>
Real Betis, a point above the drop, host a freefalling Valladolid in Sevilla
with both teams capable of going down.
</P>
<P>
Getafe, level on points with Betis, are at Racing Santander needing a win to
ensure their survival.

Football: Milan give Maldini and Ancelotti perfect send-off

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AC Milan booked their place in the Champions League group stages and gave Paolo
Maldini and Carlo Ancelotti a winning send-off as they beat Fiorentina 2-0 on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The seven-time European champions risked missing out on a top three finish and
having to negotiate two qualifying rounds in Europe next season if they lost but
goals from Kaka and Pato were enough to secure a win and third place in Serie A.
</P>
<P>
That was immediately followed by Ancelotti announcing he was leaving the club,
who then replaced him with technical director Leonardo, a former player and
World Cup winner with Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Fiorentina finished fourth following the defeat and will play those two
qualifying rounds next season while Juventus claimed second spot with a 2-0 home
win over Lazio.
</P>
<P>
But while Maldini was afforded a great reception from both sets of fans in
Florence to celebrate his 24 years as a Milan player, coach Carlo Ancelotti
avoided that by making his announcement to Sky Sport TV cameras after the match.
</P>
<P>
He claimed it was a mutual decision taken with club vice-president Adriano
Galliani, although he refused to confirm he would be joining Chelsea next
season.
</P>
<P>
"Today my beautiful Milan adventure has come to an end. Our paths are
separating. I spoke after the match to Mr Galliani and we decided to terminate
the contract," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We spoke a while back but the decision was taken at the end of the season and
it was mutual. London is not certain as a destination."
</P>
<P>
Fiorentina, who had to win to take a top three finish, started brightly and
former Milan forward Alberto Gilardino got on the end of a left-wing cross on
22-minutes but headed wide under pressure.
</P>
<P>
Just two minutes later former Arsenal star Mathieu Flamini grazed the bar with a
vicious shot from 22 yards as Milan demonstrated their potency.
</P>
<P>
Fiorentina had a good shout for a penalty on 42 minutes when Giuseppe Favalli
appeared to haul down Gilardino but the referee gave a foul the other way.
</P>
<P>
On 48 minutes the striker went close again as he curled a shot just past the
post with the outside of his right boot.
</P>
<P>
But on 55 minutes Milan took the lead with a simple move as Andrea Pirlo
released Gianluca Zambrotta down the right and although his cross was blocked by
Alessandro Gamberini, Kaka followed up to slide home the ball.
</P>
<P>
Filippo Inzaghi should have finished things on 62 minutes but he blazed over the
bar with only French goalkeeper Sebastien Frey to beat.
</P>
<P>
However substitute Pato did seal the victory on 76 minutes as he beat the
offside trap and then chipped Frey as the Frenchman went to ground.
</P>
<P>
Champions Inter Milan came back from 3-2 down to beat Atalanta 4-3 at the San
Siro as Portugal veteran Luis Figo also bowed out from the game.
</P>
<P>
Sweden forward Zlatan Ibrahimvoic also took the golden boot award after his two
goals took his tally to 25 this season.
</P>
<P>
"You can't do better than that, I'm very happy. I worked really hard for this,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"When  arrived in Italy people said I was a great player but didn't score many
goals."
</P>
<P>
Ibrahimovic refused to commit his future to Inter despite speculation
surrounding a possible move to Spain, however coach Jose Mourinho insisted his
man would stay.
</P>
<P>
"I continue to think that next year Ibra will still be an Inter player," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Czech veteran Pavel Nedved was another player departing as he played his final
game for Juventus, with two Vincenzo Iaquinta goals securing their victory.
</P>
<P>
Torino joined Reggina and Lecce in being relegated to Serie B after they lost
3-2 at AS Roma and Bologna won 3-1 at home to Catania.

French physicists claim breakthrough in ultra-fast data access
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
French physicists said on Sunday they had used ultra-fast lasers that could
accelerate storage and retrieval of data on hard discs by up to 100,000 times,
pointing the way to a new generation of IT wizardry.
</P>
<P>
The research builds on achievements that earned the 2007 Nobel physics prize for
Albert Fert of France and Peter Gruenberg of Germany, who ushered in a
revolution in miniaturised storage in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Fert and Gruenberg discovered that tiny changes in magnetic fields can yield a
large electric output.
</P>
<P>
These differences in turn cause changes in the current in the readout head that
scans a hard disk to spot the ones and zeroes in which data is stored.
</P>
<P>
That discovery opened the way to "spintronics", a form of electronics that uses
not only electrical charge but also the spin of electrons in individual atoms to
provide a more compact, denser storage on hard drives.
</P>
<P>
But reading and writing data through spintronics has been hampered by the
relative slowness of magnetic sensors.
</P>
<P>
In a study published in the specialist journal Nature Physics, a team led by
Jean-Yves Bigot of the Institute of Materials Physics and Chemistry in
Strasbourg employed a "femtosecond" laser, using ultra-fast bursts of laser
light, to alter electron spin and thus speed up retrieval and storage.
</P>
<P>
"Our method is called the photonics of spin, because it is photons [particles of
light] that modify the state of the electrons' magnetisation" on the storage
surface, Bigot told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Data is retrieved with a burst that lasts just a millionth of a billionth of a
second, said Bigot.
</P>
<P>
Femtosecond lasers currently measure around 30 centimetres (12 inches) by 10
centimetres (four inches) which means they are too big for consumer electronics,
he cautioned.
</P>
<P>
Bigot added, though, that their miniaturisation is likely to be achieved over
the next decade.
</P>
<P>
IBM, Hitachi and other corporations are "extremely interested" by the research,
Bigot said.

First genes spotted for testicular cancer
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists in Britain said Sunday they had found the first genes that are
associated with testicular cancer, the commonest form of cancer for men between
the ages of 15 and 45.
</P>
<P>
Telltale variants in chromosomes 5, 6 and 12 are linked with an increased risk
of the disease, according to their study, which compared the genetic code of 730
men who had testicular cancer with that of healthy men.
</P>
<P>
Inheriting the basket of three factors boosts the risk of the cancer, called
testicular gem cell tumour, by up to fourfold.
</P>
<P>
The study is published online in the journal Nature Genetics.
</P>
<P>
"We have known for some time that men whose father, brothers or sons had
testicular cancer are much more likely to get it themselves and we have been
searching for this genetic link," said one of the investigators, Elizabeth
Rapley of the Institute of Cancer Research, in the southern English county of
Surrey.
</P>
<P>
"We believe there are more (risk factors) still to be found and we are working
on identifying the rest."
</P>
<P>
The three telltales lie near genes that nurture testicular cells which are
precursors in sperm development.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide incidence of testicular cancer is 7.5 cases per 100,000 men, but the
rates vary remarkably between countries and according to ancestry, the ICR said
in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Why this is so is unclear. Inheritance, though, is a well-known risk factor and
seems to be far higher than for other cancer types.
</P>
<P>
Studies have found that the risk to brothers of testicular cancer patients is
eight to 10 times higher than the general population, while for fathers of
patients, the risk is four to six times higher.
</P>
<P>
Testicular cancer is 99 percent curable if caught in its early stages, the ICR
said.

Football: Perez could take charge again of Real on Monday
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MADRID, May 26, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Real Madrid president Florentino Perez could automatically take charge
again of Spain's historically most successful team on Monday if no other
candidate throws in his hat to run for president by a deadline of midnight on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old, who led Real from 2000 to 2006, was the only candidate for the
post after former club vice-president Juan Onieva withdrew his candidacy last
week, saying his proposed programme had not been well received.
</P>
<P>
Under Perez, Real earned the nickname "Los Galacticos", winning the Primera Liga
twice and the European Champions League with such stars as Zinedine Zidane,
Ronaldo, Luis Figo and David Beckham.
</P>
<P>
He officially presented his candidacy on Thursday under the slogan "the dream is
back" and said the team he would help to build would be world beaters.
</P>
<P>
"We will build a spectacular team with top notch players. We have set up a
strong and stable sporting project which will be able to call upon footballers
who will turn each Real Madrid match into a fascinating rendez-vous," he said.
</P>
<P>
Perez has not mentioned any names regarding top signings but Spanish media has
reported that Chilean Manuel Pellegrini, currently at Villarreal, would become
coach in place of Juande Ramos and the club would also land AC Milan's Brazilian
playmaker Kaka.
</P>
<P>
"I do not place any limit on myself," he said in an interview published Sunday
in top-selling daily newspaper El Pais, adding the club "needs a revolution".
</P>
<P>
Barcelona won the Champions League, the Spanish title and the Spanish Cup in a
superb season under debutant coach Pep Guardiola that left Real looking ordinary
by comparison.
</P>
<P>
But Perez said the success of Real's arch-rivals this season "motivates me even
more".
</P>
<P>
If there is more than one candidate for president, a vote will be held on June
14.
</P>
<P>
While the club normally holds elections every four years, it faces the prospect
of holding a ballot a year early due to the resignation of former president
Ramon Calderon in January.
</P>
<P>
That followed allegations he rigged voting at the club's last general assembly
in December, which approved its financial accounts.
</P>
<P>
Calderon has been replaced on an interim basis by Vicente Boluda.

Tennis: Nadal five-title dream crushed by Soderling sledgehammer
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rafael Nadal's hopes of a record fifth successive French Open title were crushed
into the Roland Garros red dust by Robin Soderling's Swedish sledgehammer on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In one of the greatest upsets in the history of the tournament, the Spanish king
of clay slumped to a first ever defeat here having racked up 31 wins in 31
outings since his 2005 debut.
</P>
<P>
Soderling's stunning 6-2, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) fourth round victory came
just a month after he'd won only one game in a 6-1, 6-0 rout at the Rome
Masters, his third defeat in three matches against the world number one.
</P>
<P>
But he was a man transformed on Sunday with the 24-year-old unleashing a
formidable service game and a relentless, pinpoint accurate forehand which
forced Nadal to constantly scramble for a foothold in the match.
</P>
<P>
"He didn't surprise me because I know how he plays and how dangerous he can be,"
said Nadal who had won the Monte Carlo, Rome and Barcelona events in the run-up
to Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't play my best. I played very short and I couldn't attack. I made it
easy for him to play at his level. But I lost.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a tragedy, I had to lose one day. I must accept my defeats with the
same level of calm that I accept my victories."
</P>
<P>
Soderling was in tears by the end.
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't believe it when I won that last point," said the Swede who has
never gone this far before in a Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so proud of myself. This is the best win of my career against a man who is
the greatest claycourt player in history."
</P>
<P>
Nadal's first set loss was the first time he had dropped a set in the tournament
since the 2007 final against Roger Federer, ending a run of 32 in a row.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard was reeling from the outset at the hands of a man whom he'd accused
of being one of the most unpopular players in the locker room after an
acrimonious Wimbledon clash two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Nadal was broken in the fourth game as 23rd seeded Soderling went to 4-1 ahead
and again in the crucial eighth as the free-flowing, uninhibited Swede continued
to find the corners with devastating accuracy.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old deservedly claimed the opening set when the champion netted a
backhand.
</P>
<P>
Nadal, despite missing his usual fluency and rattled by the unrelenting assault,
broke for the first time to lead 2-1 in the second set only to surrender his
advantage in the 10th game.
</P>
<P>
With most people inside Court Philippe Chatrier expecting a Nadal drive to fly
past the big Swede, Soderling executed a fine backhand volley to go to 5-5.
</P>
<P>
Despite those heroics, Nadal ran away with the tiebreaker to level the match
when, for once, Soderling's forehand missed its target and flew long.
</P>
<P>
The Swede, coached by compatriot and 2000 finalist Magnus Norman, refused to
yield, breaking to lead 4-3 before backing it up for a 5-3 advantage in the
third set.
</P>
<P>
He took the set when Nadal netted another weary forehand off yet another deep
Soderling drive.
</P>
<P>
Nadal broke to lead 2-0 in the fourth set, but Soderling hit back immediately as
another tiebreak loomed where the gallant Swede clinched his famous win on a
second match point when Nadal went wide with a pick-up.
</P>
<P>
Soderling sent down nine aces in the match and fired a decisive 61 winners to
the Spaniard's 33.
</P>
<P>
His reward is a match-up with either Russian 10th seed Nikolay Davydenko or
Fernando Verdasco, the eighth-seeded Spaniard for a place in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's drama would have delighted Roger Federer, who has lost the last three
finals to Nadal, and who still needs a French Open to complete a career Grand
Slam.
</P>
<P>
He plays his last 16 tie on Monday against Germany's Tommy Haas.

Football: Milan promote Leonardo as Ancelotti exits
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ROME, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AC Milan on Sunday replaced coach Carlo Ancelotti with former player and
Brazilian World Cup winner Leonardo, who was the club's technical director.
</P>
<P>
Ancelotti told Italian Sky Sport TV of his departure following the 2-0 win at
Fiorentina that ensured the seven-time European champions finished third and
avoided having to play two qualifying rounds to reach next season's Champions
League group stages.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani was announcing his
replacement on Rai TV.
</P>
<P>
Ancelotti, who still had a year to run on his contract, confirmed what had
become the worst-kept secret in Italian football in announcing his departure,
but he refused to confirm that English side Chelsea would be his destination.
</P>
<P>
"Today my beautiful Milan adventure has come to an end," said a visibly
emotional Ancelotti.
</P>
<P>
"Our paths are separating. I spoke after the match to Mr Galliani and we decided
to terminate the contract.
</P>
<P>
"We spoke a while back but the decision was taken at the end of the season and
it was mutual. London is not certain as a destination."
</P>
<P>
Ancelotti won two Champions League titles, one Serie A crown and the Club World
Cup during his eight seasons at Milan but has received heavy criticism in the
last two years for failing to mount a serious challenge to champions Inter
Milan.
</P>
<P>
But he will remain a legend at the club where he also won two European Cups as a
player, thus becoming one of the few people in history to claim Europe's premier
competition as both player and coach.
</P>
<P>
He also played for Parma and Roma and coached Reggiana, Parma and Juventus
before joining Milan in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Galliani told Rai: "Leonardo will be the new Milan coach. He will be
officially presented tomorrow (Monday) at midday.
</P>
<P>
"With Ancelotti the story is not finished. We will stay friends, we had eight
marvellous years together.
</P>
<P>
"Carlo and I are very good friends and there were a few tears in the changing
rooms."
</P>
<P>
Leonardo had long been tipped to take over from Ancelotti, with Friday's
Gazzetta dello Sport reporting that it was a done deal.
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old former midfielder and left-back played for the club from
1997-2001, winning the league title in 1999.
</P>
<P>
He was part of the Brazil squad that beat Italy to win the World Cup in 1994,
although he disgraced himself earlier in the tournament by getting sent off
against hosts the United States for elbowing Tab Ramos, resulting in a four-game
suspension that saw him miss the final.
</P>
<P>
Leonardo has no previous coaching experience but Barcelona's Pep Guardiola has
proved novices can shine after winning an incredible treble in his debut season
in charge of the Catalans.

Motorcycling: Stoner ends Rossi's seven year reign at Mugello
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SCARPERIA, Italy, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Casey Stoner held off the fast-finishing Jorge Lorenzo to win the Italian Grand
Prix on Sunday and bring to an end Valentino Rossi's seven-year reign here.
</P>
<P>
The Australian also took over the lead in the world championship standings with
his second win of the season having also triumphed in Qatar in the opening race
of the season.
</P>
<P>
He now leads Lorenzo, who started on pole here, by four points in the
championship standings with Rossi third, a further five points back.
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic race that began in wet conditions, Stoner seized the advantage
when switching bikes after 10 laps for a change of tyres.
</P>
<P>
"Once I got onto the slicks I found a good feeling immediately and I was able to
get to the front quite quickly, but then I started having a problem with the
clutch," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It was a really hard race and I just wanted to finish it. I just tried to stay
smooth and keep the same lap times even if I couldn’t ride the way I wanted
to."
</P>
<P>
He was the fastest man on the track by some margin in those first few laps after
the switch and although Yamaha pair Lorenzo and Rossi were quickest at the end,
they had both lost too much time and too many places to hit back.
</P>
<P>
Rossi blamed his team for making the wrong choice of tyre in the dry, going for
the harder compound.
</P>
<P>
"It's a precious result, it's also nice to be on the podium. The race was really
difficult, we knew the weather would be terrible," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the dry we made a mistake in going with the hard tyres. The choice of hards
was made even though I wanted the soft ones."
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo said he was delighted with his finish having slid off on the warm-up lap
and skidded at the start.
</P>
<P>
"Honestly, this is as good as a win for me and I can't really believe the race
today, it was like a movie," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a really amazing result because things could have been much worse today,
so thank you again to everyone for making it possible. I'm really happy with
this result."
</P>
<P>
Stoner completed the 23 laps in 45min 41.894sec to beat Lorenzo by just over a
second.
</P>
<P>
In an exciting race the pole-sitter got off to a terrible start in the wet and
immediately dropped to eighth.
</P>
<P>
Quickest off the mark were Australian Chris Vermeulen, who started 11th, and
Andrea Dovizioso, who began seventh but Stoner passed them both on the long
straight at the beginning of the second lap.
</P>
<P>
Vermeulen quickly started heading backwards, eventually finishing 10th, as Rossi
started to move up from fifth.
</P>
<P>
However Italian Marco Melandri on a Kawasaki, who started 15th on the grid, was
clearly fastest in the wet.
</P>
<P>
Rossi took the lead from Dovizioso, who had got back past Stoner, on the seventh
lap and two laps later he lost that to Melandri.
</P>
<P>
However, on the 10th lap all the front runners came into the pits for a change
of bikes and when they came out, Stoner was quickest to find his pace.
</P>
<P>
Melandri immediately started heading backwards, eventually finishing 11th and
35sec back, while Loris Capirossi propelled himself into race contention with
Stoner and Dovizioso.
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo and Rossi initially struggled with their bikes down in fifth and sixth
and the time they lost over those first three laps coming out of the pits
essentially cost either of them a chance of victory.
</P>
<P>
While Stoner had soon taken the race lead, both Yamaha riders had to then pass
Melandri, Capirossi and Dovizioso and by the time they had done so, Stoner was
over a second ahead and with only a couple of laps remaining.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile former Superbikes champion James Toseland of Britain got his best
finish of the season in seventh, benefitting from being the first man into the
pits to change his bike.
</P>
<P>
It meant that his tyres were warm and he was flying as the fastest man on track
for a few laps when everyone else was simply trying to get temperature into
their new tyres.

<P>
Danny Kirmond's late try saw Huddersfield reach the Challenge Cup semi-finals on
Sunday as they beat Castleford 16-14.
</P>
<P>
Kirmond's 77th minute try completed a great comeback for the hosts.
</P>

Castleford had one foot in the semi-finals when Brett Ferres' converted try gave
them a 14-6 lead ten minutes after the break.
</P>

But the Giants hit back in the final 12 minutes through Stephen Wild before
Kirmond crossed to snatch the win.
</P>
<P>
Castleford had taken a fifth minute lead through Michael Shenton's try but Kevin
Brown's four-pointer, converted by former Wests full-back Brett Hodgson, made it
6-6 at the break.
</P>
<P>
Ferres and two goals from Kirk Dixon gave Cas a cushion but they were left
stunned at the death.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday Warrington stand-off Lee Briers dropped a golden-point drop-goal to
dump in-form Hull KR out of the Challenge Cup, 25-24.
</P>
<P>
In a desperate search for the winning points, Briers had already failed with
three drop goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
However, Briers refused to throw in the towel and finally succeeded on his
fourth attempt to send the Wolves into the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
The tense victory avenged Warrington's quarter-final defeat in 2006, when then
National League One side Rovers sprung a famous victory to secure a place in the
last four.
</P>
<P>
The nailbiting quarter-final went to golden point time after the clash finished
24-24 after 80 minutes, thanks to Michael Dobson's last-gasp penalty.
</P>
<P>
The home side took the lead inside three minutes when Paul Cooke's pass allowed
Peter Fox to send through Kris Welham under the posts.
</P>
<P>
The lead didn't last long as Warrington drew level thanks to Vinnie Anderson,
which saw the first-half finish all square.
</P>
<P>
Warrington took the lead after the break as Jon Clarke touched down but the
Robins bounced back with quick tries from ex-Newcastle Knights forward Clint
Newton, Ben Galea and Jake Webster.
</P>
<P>
The visitors regained their composure and reduced the deficit to four points
when Matt King touched down before Chris Bridge once again put the visitors in
front.
</P>
<P>
A Dobson penalty levelled the scores just before full-time, forcing the match
into a sudden-death golden-point thriller, until Briers' settled it.
</P>
<P>
St Helens eased into the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup with a thumping 12-try
66-6 victory over Gateshead.
</P>
<P>
The win also included Sean Long's 1,000th goal for the club, while former
Australia centre Matt Gidley and ex-Sydney Roosters second-row Chris Flannery
grabbed doubles for Saints.
</P>
<P>
Wigan moved to within a sight of a return to Wembley after an 11-year absence
with a 28-6 win over Salford.
</P>
<P>
Former Wests winger Pat Richards was the star of the show with a hat-trick of
tries and eight points with the boot.
</P>
<P>
In the weekend's only Super League fixture, Wakefield racked up a half century
of points against Celtic Crusaders, winning 50-6.
</P>
<P>
Wakefield ran in nine tries, with the game all but over at the break as Trinity
led by 30 points.
</P>
<P>
Trinity's tries came from Ryan Atkins, Michael Korkidas, Scott Grix, Danny
Brough and Brad Drew before the break, while Jamie Rooney went over twice,
before Steve Snitch and Drew, with his second, completed the rout.

Israel names new negotiator for Hamas prisoner swap
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Jerusalem, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday appointed a new envoy to
head indirect negotiations on a prisoner swap with the Islamist Hamas rulers of
the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Hagai Hadas, a former commander in the Mossad spy agency, will oversee talks on
the release of soldier Gilad Shalit, held in Gaza since his capture by
Palestinian militants in June 2006, the premier's office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Hamas and Israel blame each other for the failure of negotiations in Cairo in
mid-March aimed at securing a deal under which Israel would free hundreds of
Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Shalit.
</P>
<P>
Ofer Dekel, the previous Israeli prisoner negotiator who was appointed by former
prime minister Ehud Olmert, stepped down shortly after Netanyahu took office in
March.
</P>
<P>
The talks on a swap have not resumed since Netanyahu's right-leaning government
took office at the start of April, and the premier has so far refused to say
whether he accepts the framework of the previous negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which launched a devastating 22-day onslaught on Hamas in Gaza in
December, has made the release of Shalit a precondition for a lasting ceasefire
and an end to its blockade of the enclave.
</P>
<P>
A corporal at the time of his capture, Shalit has since been promoted to staff
sergeant.

Tennis: Safina powers on, Ivanovic heads home
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Top seed Dinara Safina won at a canter to reach the French Open quarter-finals
on Sunday but it will not be title-holder Ana Ivanovic she meets there after the
Serb lost 6-2, 6-3 to Victoria Azarenka
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Russian brushed aside the challenge of France's Aravane Rezai
6-1, 6-0 in a centre-court mis-match and has conceded just five games in four
matches.
</P>
<P>
Also through and into her first Grand Slam quarter-final was Slovakia's Dominika
Cibulkova who had too much movement about the court and allround ability for
Agnes Szavay of Hungary winning 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
She will play the winner of the day's remaining fourth round tie between former
world No 1 Maria Sharpova of Russia and Li Na who is bidding to become the first
Chinese player to reach the last eight at Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
Azaranka's win over Ivanovic was no great surprise as she has won three titles
this year already while Ivanovic has been laid low with injury and poor form.
</P>
<P>
Two breaks of serve in the sixth and eighth games were enough to clinch the
first set for the Arizona-based player and when she went 4-0 up in the second it
was all but over.
</P>
<P>
With the crowd cheering for Ivanovic and jeering Azarenko, the Serb did manage
two breaks of her own after that, but she could not hold onto her own serve
allowing the Belarussian to close out the tie.
</P>
<P>
Azarenka said she had not been upset by the crowd clearly favouring her
opponent.
</P>
<P>
"It was expected because she was the champion, but I hope they will be little
bit more for me now," she said.
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time I have made the quarter-finals (of a Grand Slam) and it's a
big step for me.
</P>
<P>
"It will be tough against Safina because she has lost only one match on clay
this year and has been killing people, but I will be ready."
</P>
<P>
Ivanovic said she had been feeling unwell from the middle of the first set.
</P>
<P>
"I started really well and felt good, but after the third point of the fourth
game I started to feel dizzy and lost my balance. It was really hard after
that."
</P>
<P>
Safina's win over Rezai was the perfect result for her as she closes in on
winning a first Grand Slam title and proving to herself and her detractors that
she is a worthy world No.1.
</P>
<P>
But it was a poor advertisement for women's tennis as the stage-struck
Frenchwoman, who won her first tournament as a professional in Strasbourg
earlier this month, capitulated in just 53 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"Getting into the quarter-finals like this feels good," said Safina.
</P>
<P>
"I remember Australia (where she reached the final) this year and I don't know
how many hours I needed there so I am feeling good right now.
</P>
<P>
"Since I became number one I am playing better and better."
</P>
<P>
Safina's quickfire win was her 18th win out of 19 matches on clay this season
and confirmed her status as favourite to win her first Grand Slam title.
</P>
<P>
Cibulkova, at 1.61 metres one of the smallest players on the WTA circuit,
dominated the rallies against Szavay from the start of their match jumping out
into a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian, who stunned Venus Williams in the third round, steadied the ship
in the fifth game but by that time the first set was out of her reach, Cibulkova
taking it 6-2 in 38 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Cibulkova wiped out an early break against her in the second set as she won five
games in a row but failed to convert a match point in the following game and had
to wait till her next service game to wrap things up.
</P>
<P>
She will next go up against the winner of the tie between Sharapova and Li
knowing that she has already taken a step up the career ladder at Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to lose from now on in," the Slovak said.
</P>
<P>
"I was injured before Roland Garros (leg muscle) and didn't play the big
tournaments, so I was a bit afraid. But now it's amazing."

Abortion doctor shot dead at his Kansas church: report
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Wichita, Kansas, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A controversial provider of late-term abortions was shot to death Sunday as he
walked into services at his Kansas church, local media reports.
</P>
<P>
A lightning rod in the bitter culture war over abortion, George Tiller has been
picketed, bombed and shot in the arms.
</P>
<P>
He was shot to death just after 10 am (1500 GMT) as he walked into Reformation
Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kansas, the Wichita Eagle reported.
</P>
<P>
Police contacted by AFP could not immediately confirm the report but said
details of an incident at the church would be released later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Tiller, 67, one of the few doctors who still performs late-term abortions in the
United States, has been demonized by abortion opponents who regularly protest
outside his clinic, located just off a busy highway that runs through Wichita.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, someone placed a bomb on the roof of the clinic, seriously damaging the
building.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Tiller was shot in both arms outside the clinic. Tiller recovered, and
his assailant received an 11-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 protesters were also arrested outside the clinic during summer-long
demonstrations in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He was acquitted in March on charges that he performed 19 illegal abortions in
2003.

Six die in shootout between Fatah and Hamas - New offer

QALQILIYA, West Bank

Six people were killed in a West Bank shoot-out on Sunday when an attempt to
arrest a senior Hamas commander went awry, deepening the rift between the two
main Palestinian factions. The Islamist Hamas movement ruling the Gaza Strip
warned that the rival Fatah group loyal to president Mahmud Abbas had crossed a
"red line" over the killing of one of its top fighters in the arrest operation.
The firefight erupted when Palestinian police dominated by Fatah tried to arrest
Mohammed al-Samman, commander of Hamas's armed wing in the northern West Bank,
who was also on Israel's wanted list.

Football: AC Milan replace Ancelotti with Leonardo

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AC Milan on Sunday replaced coach Carlo Ancelotti with former player and
Brazilian World Cup winner Leonardo, who was the club's technical director on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
While Ancelotti was telling Italian Sky Sport TV that he was leaving, Galliani
was announcing his replacement to Rai.
</P>
<P>
"Leonardo will be the new Milan coach. He will be officially presented tomorrow
(Monday) at midday," he told them, confirming a claim made in Friday's Gazzetta
dello Sport.
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old played for the club from 1997-2001, winning the league title in
1999.
</P>
<P>
He was part of the Brazil squad that beat Italy to win the World Cup in 1994,
although he disgraced himself earlier in the tournament by getting sent off
against hosts the United States for elbowing Tab Ramos, resulting in a four-game
suspension that saw him miss the final.
</P>

Leonardo has no previous coaching experience but Barcelona's Pep Guardiola has
proved novices can shine after winning an incredible treble in his season in
charge of the Catalans.

Zimbabwe PM's party bemoans pace of change
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HARARE, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's party bemoaned the slow pace of change in
Zimbabwe's fledgling coalition on Sunday, calling for the central bank chief and
attorney general to quit immediately.
</P>
<P>
In resolutions at the end of its annual conference, the Movement for Democratic
Change also called for a regional summit to resolve differences dogging the
unity government between Tsvangirai and President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
The MDC has long criticised Mugabe's decision to retain central bank chief
Gideon Gono and attorney-general Johannes Tomana but Tsvangirai tried to take
the heat out of the issue last week when he said their future should be decided
by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), a regional bloc.
</P>
<P>
However in the resolutions, the MDC said both men should go immediately.
</P>
<P>
"Aware of the conflict and divisive effect of the issues ... conference calls
that in the national interest Johannes Tomana and Gideon Gono resign forthwith,"
the MDC said in resolutions read by secretary-general Tendai Biti, who is also
Zimbabwe's finance minister.
</P>
<P>
Tsvangirai encountered tough resistance within the MDC about entering a power-
sharing deal with Mugabe in February and the resolution made clear the party is
unhappy about what it sees as a lack of reform and continued intimidation of its
supporters by pro-Mugabe militias.
</P>
<P>
The party said the government must address "the slow pace of media reforms, slow
implementation of the government 100-day plan, continued deployment of the
military in villages and the existence of militia and ghost workers on the
government payroll."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister sought to reassure his supporters at the end of the
conference saying he had not abandoned the party's objectives.
</P>
<P>
"The transitional government, which is a coalition government is a stepping
stone to a new and democratic Zimbabwe," he said but expressing disappoitment at
delays in implementing the coalition agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We are disappointed at the pace of the implementation of some of the issues in
the global political agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The party's agenda must not be diluted by the government's agenda. We must also
acknowledge that in a marriage like this there are likely to be compromises but
we must not demobilise saying 'we have arrived.' We must continue to streng our
party structures in preparations for elections."
</P>
<P>
The MDC is particularly keen to see the back of Gono, who has been widely
criticised for failing to stop the Zimbabwean economy's freefall and slide into
world record inflation.
</P>
<P>
Tomana is also accused of having overseen politically-inspired prosecutions in
the aftermath of last year's disputed presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Tsvangirai won the first round of voting in March last year but pulled out of a
run-off after scores of MDC were killed in attacks the party blamed on Mugabe's
followers.
</P>
<P>
The conference also called on the inclusive government to support victims of
political violence.
</P>
<P>
"Concerned with the plight of victims of political violence ... conference
resolves that the inclusive government vigilantly addresses the issue of the
welfare of victims," the party said.

Carlo Ancelotti announced he was quitting AC Milan following their 2-0 win at
Fiorentina on the last day of the Serie A season on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani then announced that former player and
Brazil World Cup winning midfielder Leonardo, the club's technical director,
would be taking over the hot-seat.
</P>
<P>
A visibly emotional Ancelotti, who is widely tipped to take over at Chelsea,
told Italian Sky Sport TV: "Today my beautiful Milan adventure has come to an
end."
</P>
<P>
Ancelotti, who still had a year to run on his contract, confirmed what had
become the worst kept secret in Italian football in announcing his departure,
however he refused to confirm that Chelsea would be his destination.
</P>
<P>
"Our paths are separating. I spoke after the match to Mr Galliani and we decided
to terminate the contract.
</P>
<P>
"We spoke a while back but the decision was taken at the end of the season and
it was mutual.
</P>
<P>
"London is not certain as a destination."
</P>
<P>
Ancelotti won two Champions League titles, one Serie A crown and the Club World
Cup during his eight seasons at Milan but was coming under heavy criticism the
last two years for failing to push champions Inter Milan closer.

Tennis: Nadal crushed by Soderling sledgehammer

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rafael Nadal's hopes of a record fifth successive French Open title were crushed
into the Roland Garros red dust by Robin Soderling's Swedish sledgehammer on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In one of the greatest upsets in the tournament's history, the Spanish king of
clay slumped to a first ever defeat here having racked up 31 wins in 31 outings
since his 2005 debut.
</P>
<P>
Soderling's stunning 6-2, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) victory came just a month
after he'd won only one game in a 6-1, 6-0 rout at the Rome Masters, his third
defeat in three matches against the world number one.
</P>
<P>
But he was man transformed on Sunday with the 24-year-old unleashing a
formidable service game and a relentless, pinpoint accurate forehand which
forced Nadal to constantly scramble for a foothold in the match.
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't believe it when I won that last point," said a tearful
Soderling who has never gone this far before in a Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so proud of myself. This is the best win of my career against a man who is
the greatest claycourt player in history. But I told myself before the match
that I had to believe I could win."
</P>
<P>
Nadal's first set loss was the first time he had dropped a set in the tournament
since the 2007 final against Roger Federer, ending a run of 32 in a row.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard was reeling from the outset at the hands of a man whom he'd accused
of being one of the most unpopular players in the locker room after an
acrimonious Wimbledon clash two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Nadal was broken in the fourth game as 23rd seeded Soderling went to 4-1 ahead
and again in the crucial eighth as the free-flowing, uninhibited Swede continued
to find the corners with devastating accuracy.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old deservedly claimed the opening set when the champion netted a
backhand.
</P>
<P>
Nadal, despite missing his usual fluency and rattled by the unrelenting assault,
broke for the first time to lead 2-1 in the second set only to surrender his
advantage in the 10th game.
</P>
<P>
With most people inside Court Philippe Chatrier expecting a Nadal drive to fly
past the big Swede, Soderling executed a fine backhand volley to go to 5-5.
</P>
<P>
Despite those heroics, Nadal ran away with the tiebreaker to level the match
when, for once, Soderling's forehand missed its target and flew long.
</P>
<P>
The Swede, coached by compatriot and 2000 finalist Magnus Norman, refused to
yield, breaking to lead 4-3 before backing it up for a 5-3 advantage in the
third set.
</P>
<P>
He took the set when Nadal netted another weary forehand off yet another deep
Soderling drive.
</P>
<P>
Nadal broke to lead 2-0 in the fourth set, but Soderling hit back immediately as
another tiebreak loomed where the gallant Swede clinched his famous win on a
second match point when Nadal went wide with a pick-up.
</P>
<P>
Soderling sent down nine aces in the match and fired a decisive 61 winners to
the Spaniard's 33.
</P>
<P>
His reward is a match-up with either Russian 10th seed Nikolay Davydenko or
Fernando Verdasco, the eighth-seeded Spaniard for a place in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's drama would have delighted Roger Federer, who has lost the last three
finals to Nadal, and who still needs a French Open to complete a career Grand
Slam.
</P>
<P>
He plays his last 16 tie on Monday against Germany's Tommy Haas.

Notorcycling: Stoner ends Rossi's seven year reign at Mugello
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SCARPERIA, Italy, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Casey Stoner held off the fast-finishing Jorge Lorenzo to win the Italian Grand
Prix on Sunday and bring to an end Valentino Rossi's seven-year reign here.
</P>
<P>
The Australian also took over the lead in the world championship standings with
his second win of the season having also triumphed in Qatar in the opening race
of the season.
</P>
<P>
He now leads Lorenzo, who started on pole here, by four points in the
championship standings with Rossi third, a further five points back.
</P>
<P>
Rossi blamed his team for making the wrong choice of tyre in the dry, going for
the harder compound.
</P>
<P>
"It's a precious result, it's also nice to be on the podium. The race was really
difficult, we knew the weather would be terrible," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the dry we made a mistake in going with the hard tyres. The choice of hards
was made even though I wanted the soft ones."
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo said he was delighted with his finish having slid off on the warm-up lap
and skidded at the start.
</P>
<P>
"Honestly, this is as good as a win for me and I can’t really believe the race
today, it was like a movie," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This morning in the warm-up I was quite worried because I was slow in the rain,
then on the formation lap I slid off into the gravel pit.
</P>
<P>
"On the grid I tried not to think about the crash, I just tried to focus. But
then I had a big slide off the line and the first part of the race wasn’t so
good for me.
</P>
<P>
"It’s a really amazing result because things could have been much worse today,
so thank you again to everyone for making it possible. I’m really happy with
this result."
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic race that began in wet conditions, Stoner seized the advantage
when switching bikes after 10 laps for a change of tyres.
</P>
<P>
He was the fastest man on the track by some margin in those first few laps after
the switch and although Yamaha pair Lorenzo and Rossi were quickest at the end,
they had both lost too much time and too many places to hit back.
</P>
<P>
Stoner completed the 23 laps in 45min 41.894sec to beat Lorenzo by just over a
second.
</P>
<P>
In an exciting race the pole-sitter got off to a terrible start in the wet and
immediately dropped to eighth.
</P>
<P>
Quickest off the mark were Australian Chris Vermeulen, who started 11th, and
Andrea Dovizioso, who began seventh but Stoner passed them both on the long
straight at the beginning of the second lap.
</P>
<P>
Vermeulen quickly started heading backwards, eventually finishing 10th, as Rossi
started to move up from fifth.
</P>
<P>
However Italian Marco Melandri on a Kawasaki, who started 15th on the grid, was
clearly fastest in the wet.
</P>
<P>
Rossi took the lead from Dovizioso, who had got back past Stoner, on the seventh
lap and two laps later he lost that to Melandri.
</P>
<P>
However, on the 10th lap all the front runners came into the pits for a change
of bikes and when they came out, Stoner was quickest to find his pace.
</P>
<P>
Melandri immediately started heading backwards, eventually finishing 11th and
35sec back, while Loris Capirossi propelled himself into race contention with
Stoner and Dovizioso.
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo and Rossi initially struggled with their bikes down in fifth and sixth
and the time they lost over those first three laps coming out of the pits,
essentially cost either of them a chance of victory.
</P>
<P>
While Stoner had soon taken the race lead, both Yamaha riders had to then pass
Melandri, Capirossi and Dovizioso and by the time they had done so, Stoner was
over a second ahead and with only a couple of laps remaining.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile former Superbikes champion James Toseland of Britain got his best
finish of the season in seventh, benefitting from being the first man into the
pits to change his bike.
</P>
<P>
It meant that his tyres were warm and he was flying as the fastest man on track
for a few laps when everyone else was simply trying to get temperature into
their new tyres.

Cycling: Russian delight as Menchov wins Tour of Italy
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ROME, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russian rider Denis Menchov won the Tour of Italy here on Sunday following the
14.4 kilometres time-trial round.
</P>
<P>
The Rabobank cyclist - who is the third Russian to win the race - won despite
suffering a dramatic fall in the last kilometre of the stage.
</P>
<P>
Italian 2007 champion Danilo Di Luca finished second with his compatriot Franco
Pellizzoti rounding off the podium finishers.
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian Ignatas Konovalovas of the Cervelo team won the final stage in a time
of 18min 42sec with Briton Bradley Wiggins only a second back and Norway's
Edvald Boasson Hagen in third.
</P>
<P>
Menchov finished 10th on the stage with Di Luca 16th.
</P>
<P>
The Russian had a 20sec lead coming into the final day in one of the closest
ever finishes to a Giro, in it's centenary year.
</P>
<P>
Di Luca briefly looked to be on the brink of a famous victory when he got to the
first time check fastest of all and 5sec up on Menchov.
</P>
<P>
But the LPR rider had blasted out too fast, gradually fading from there and he
was 14sec down on Menchov at the next time check.
</P>
<P>
When he came over the line, Di Luca had lost 45sec to Konovalovas whereas
Menchov, who had won the 12th stage time-trial to take over the pink jersey last
Thursday, was getting stronger.
</P>
<P>
The Russian looked like he may even win the final time-trial as well but with
rain spitting down drama unfolded in the final kilometre.
</P>
<P>
Riding in a straight line but on a cobbled section, Menchov suddenly crashed
with just 1km left to ride.
</P>
<P>
However quick thinking from his mechanic may have secured him the victory.
</P>
<P>
As Menchov was still sliding along the wet surface, his mechanic had already
jumped out of the team car and was unloading another bike from the roof.
</P>
<P>
Menchov went to pick up his splayed bike but received a shout from the mechanic
and instead jumped straight onto the new one and was back on his way, courtesy
of a push from the mechanic as well.
</P>
<P>
He had been going so well, though, that he still had time to spare on Di Luca
and despite the crash he gained 21sec on his rival to win by 41sec overall.
</P>
<P>
Pellizotti finished just under two minutes down with Tour de France champion
Carlos Sastre fourth and seven-time Tour winner Lance Armstrong 12th.

ICRC 'gravely concerned' at Pakistan's Swat Valley situation
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senior Red Cross officials who visited Pakistan's Swat Valley said Sunday they
were "gravely concerned" over the humanitarian situation as Pakistani soldiers
battled to crush the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
"The organisation is gravely concerned about the plight of civilians in Swat and
believes their situation demands a prompt and comprehensive humanitarian
response," said a statement released from the Geneva headquarters of the
International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC).
</P>
<P>
"The ICRC will do its utmost to meet those needs without delay," said Pascal
Cuttat, head of the organisation's delegation in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Given what we have already seen on the ground, we are mobilising additional
resources, but safe and unimpeded access to the area remains essential for our
teams to deliver," he added.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers had been alarmed at what they saw when they entered the region,
where the fighting between the Pakistani army and Taliban fighters for the pass
month has left civilians trapped and isolated for weeks.
</P>
<P>
"There is no running water, no electricity, and food is scarce," said Daniel
O'Malley, who led the IRCR team into the region.
</P>
<P>
"Phone lines are down, so people have been cut off from the outside world and
are anxious for contact with relatives who fled the area," he added.
</P>
<P>
Red Cross workers were also disturbed at conditions in Khwazakhela hospital, one
of the few medical facilities still left operating in Swat.
</P>
<P>
"The handful of hospital staff left are struggling to work without any water,
electricity or supplies," said O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
"They simply cannot cope with the influx of patients."
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross evacuated 14 patients from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's defence secretary Syed Athar Ali said Sunday the army was gaining on
the Taliban and fighting could be over in a few days.
</P>
<P>
Swat valley's main town Mingora is back in government hands, a critical
milestone in an offensive launched after the Taliban thrust to within 100
kilometres (60 miles) of Islamabad in April.
</P>
<P>
The defence chief told a security forum in Singapore that three targeted
northwest districts were almost clear of Taliban rebels.
</P>
<P>
"Only five to 10 percent of the job is remaining and hopefully within the next
two to three days these pockets of resistance will be cleared," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which is firmly backing the current military drive, had
warned that the rebels threaten Pakistan's very existence.
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday the military relaxed a curfew Sunday in most parts of the northwest
including Mingora to allow people trapped on the roads to return home or leave
the region.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC is one of the very few humanitarian organizations working in Swat
before the conflict broke out and has been trying to return there since early
this month. Despite some openings it said access to areas affected by the
fighting remains too limited.
</P>
<P>
It also continues to support camps run by the Pakistan Red Crescent Society,
where over 20,000 people driven from their homes by the fighting are currently
living.

Tennis: Nadal crushed by Soderling sledgehammer
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rafael Nadal's hopes of a record fifth successive French Open title were crushed
into the Roland Garros red dust by Robin Soderling's Swedish sledgehammer on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In one of the greatest upsets in the tournament's history, the Spanish king of
clay slumped to a first ever defeat here having racked up 31 wins in 31 outings
since his 2005 debut.
</P>
<P>
Soderling's stunning 6-2, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) victory came just a month
after he'd won only one game in a 6-1, 6-0 rout at the Rome Masters, his third
defeat in three matches against the world number one.
</P>
<P>
But he was man transformed on Sunday with the 24-year-old unleashing a
formidable service game and a relentless, pinpoint accurate forehand which
forced Nadal to constantly scramble for a foothold in the match.
</P>
<P>
Nadal's first set loss was the first time he had dropped a set in the tournament
since the 2007 final against Roger Federer, ending a run of 32 in a row.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard was reeling from the outset at the hands of a man whom he'd accused
of being one of the most unpopular players in the locker room after an
acrimonious Wimbledon clash two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Nadal was broken in the fourth game as 23rd seeded Soderling went to 4-1 ahead
and again in the crucial eighth as the free-flowing, uninhibited Swede continued
to find the corners with devastating accuracy.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old deservedly claimed the opening set when the champion netted a
backhand.
</P>
<P>
Nadal, despite missing his usual fluency and rattled by the unrelenting assault,
broke for the first time to lead 2-1 in the second set only to surrender his
advantage in the 10th game.
</P>
<P>
With most people inside Court Philippe Chatrier expecting a Nadal drive to fly
past the big Swede, Soderling executed a fine backhand volley to go to 5-5.
</P>
<P>
Despite those heroics, Nadal ran away with the tiebreaker to level the match
when, for once, Soderling's forehand missed its target and flew long.
</P>
<P>
The Swede, coached by compatriot and 2000 finalist Magnus Norman, refused to
yield, breaking to lead 4-3 before backing it up for a 5-3 advantage in the
third set.
</P>
<P>
He took the set when Nadal netted another weary forehand off yet another deep
Soderling drive.
</P>
<P>
Nadal broke to lead 2-0 in the fourth set, but Soderling hit back immediately as
another tiebreak loomed where the gallant Swede clinched his famous win on a
second match point when Nadal went wide with a pick-up.
</P>
<P>
His reward is a match-up with either Russian 10th seed Nikolay Davydenko or
Fernando Verdasco, the eighth-seeded Spaniard for a place in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's drama would have delighted Roger Federer, who has lost the last three
finals to Nadal, and who still needs a French Open to complete a career Grand
Slam.
</P>
<P>
He plays his last 16 tie on Monday against Germany's Tommy Haas.

Boyle looks to the future despite British talent show defeat
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unlikely Scottish singing sensation Susan Boyle was plotting her future Sunday
after her defeat in the "Britain's Got Talent" television show, which made her a
worldwide star thanks to Internet exposure.
</P>
<P>
Boyle, a frumpy, 48-year-old church volunteer, will reportedly earn up to eight
million pounds (nine million euros, 13 million dollars) in the next year from a
record deal, a book about her life and even a film.
</P>
<P>
She is set to start rehearsing for an album of showtunes this week and will fly
to Prague next month for recording sessions with the Czech National Symphony
Orchestra, British media said.
</P>
<P>
Boyle's career looks likely to reach new heights even though she lost to the
multi-ethnic street dancers Diversity in a public vote after the live talent
show final late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Despite winning praise from the audience and the judges, she was forced into
second place. The "best people won", she said, wishing the dance troupe winners
"all the best".
</P>
<P>
After the contest, "Britain's Got Talent" judge Piers Morgan called her "the
greatest discovery the show's ever found".
</P>
<P>
He added: "I'm only sorry that the extraordinary tidal wave of publicity she
attracted meant so many people got either bored or irritated by Boyle mania and
decided not to vote for her as a result," he wrote on his blog.
</P>
<P>
Boyle has enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame over the past two months after video
footage of her audition piece for the show, "I Dreamed A Dream" from the musical
"Les Miserables", was posted on YouTube.
</P>
<P>
It has had at least 100 million hits and brought her celebrity fans including
actress Demi Moore and rock star Jon Bon Jovi, who embraced the dowdy spinster
from small-town Scotland with a voice worthy of Broadway.
</P>
<P>
Bookmakers made her the favourite to win, but after an unconvincing semi-final
performance, there were fears that Boyle, who was starved of oxygen at birth and
has mild learning difficulties, was suffering under the pressure.
</P>
<P>
She was spoken to by police after an outburst at the London hotel where she was
staying, while Morgan described her as "a frightened rabbit in headlights" and
said she had considered quitting the contest.
</P>
<P>
But in a live performance in the final Saturday, she proved the critics wrong
and repeated her audition piece with gusto.
</P>
<P>
Following her performance, Boyle -- wearing a grey-blue, long sequined dress --
was asked if it was worth all the media pressure, she replied: "Well worth
it!... I really feel at home on stage, I'm among friends."
</P>
<P>
As for her future plans, she added: "I hope to get an album out -- I'll just
play it by ear. What a journey -- unbelievable, and very humbling."
</P>
<P>
A total of 19.2 million people watched the show in Britain, making it the most
popular television programme for five years.
</P>
<P>
Just under four million people voted, broadcaster ITV said, with 24.9 percent
backing Diversity and 20.2 percent Boyle.
</P>
<P>
Boyle's performance was also watched by hundreds of fans in her home town of
Blackburn, outside Edinburgh, where she lives in social housing with only her
cat Pebbles for company.
</P>
<P>
"She told me that after the final, she wants to come back and resume her
previous life," one of Boyle's neighbours, 24-year-old housewife Vicky McLean
told the Mail on Sunday newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"She doesn't want to make millions and go to America, she just wants to sing. I
think all she really hopes to have out of it is enough money to buy her house."

a special significance for his side after their country had become a virtual
'no-go zone' for international cricket.
</P>
<P>
A terror attack on the Sri Lanka team bus in Lahore in March saw seven of their
players and English assistant coach Paul Farbrace injured.
</P>
<P>
Eight Pakistanis, including six security force personnel, were killed.
</P>
<P>
With no international side willing to travel to Pakistan, Younus's men recently
returned to international action in the United Arab Emirates against Australia,
where they lost 3-2 in a one-day series but won the lone Twenty20.
</P>
<P>
"It is special to be back on the world stage, especially in Twenty20 and in
England, the media are here so lots of hopes are here," the talented batsman
told reporters at Lord's here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We are suffering from not playing regularly, and no-one is coming to Pakistan,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan endured a nailbiting defeat at the hands of arch-rivals India in the
2007 World Twenty20 final in South Africa and Younus would love nothing more
than for his team to go one better this time.
</P>
<P>
"My confidence is that I'll take this trophy to Pakistan," he said. But such has
been Pakistan's relative lack of international cricket that he added: "It will
be an achievement for us to finish in the top four."
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on the 2007 final, Younus said: "The finishing touches were not
there. We needed only five runs. But it was fantastic to be a part of that team
in the final.
</P>
<P>
"Some guys were crying at the end, but hopefully we'll have the finishing
touches," Younus said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty20 tends to put a premium on big-hitting batsmen at the start of the
innings but Younus, whose team face England and the Netherlands in Group B, said
it was not necessary to start going for big shots right from the off.
</P>
<P>
"Twenty20 looks short, but it's not - 120 balls is enough.
</P>
<P>
"If you bat normally but with energy, especially in the middle order and with
good runners between the wickets, 180-90 is very easy.
</P>
<P>
"In English conditions the new ball does seam, so you need someone like Salman
Butt who can play for 20 overs. But in the middle order, we have big hitters
like Shahid Afridi and Misbah-Ul-Haq."
</P>
<P>
English officials have already announced that plans are well advanced for
Pakistan to play two Tests against Australia in England next year as well as a
series with Andrew Strauss's men.
</P>
<P>
Large Asian communities in England provide Pakistan with a ready-made fan base
and Younus said: "Playing in England is everyone's dream. My first Test at
Lord's was fantastic for me.
</P>
<P>
"England is the home of cricket, it is an achievement for us to play Tests here,
and maybe ODIs too. It's good for the youngsters to play in England and the old
guys have a lot of friends here.
</P>
<P>
"We need the passion in Twenty20 and in England, a lot of followers all the
time, a lot of cities have Pakistanis and Indians. That's the main reason I'm
happy to be in England."
</P>
<P>
Younus added: "If we play good cricket it will be good for our nation. These
days all the nation is depressed.
</P>
<P>
"Only cricket - if we play well and win something - they will cheer. To finish
in the top four, my nation will come again and start cheering."

Myanmar's Suu Kyi trades barbs with junta over trial
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
YANGON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Myanmar's military junta accused Aung San Suu Kyi Sunday of covering up a visit
to her home by a US man which led to her trial, as the pro-democracy icon hit
back against the "bullying" generals.
</P>
<P>
The regime said the Nobel laureate was not above the law and issued its sternest
warning yet against foreign interference in the case, under which she faces up
to five years' jail for breaching her house arrest.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi has proclaimed her innocence at the closed prison trial,
insisting that she only offered "temporary shelter" to American John Yettaw
after he swam to her lakeside house, and has branded the proceedings as biased.
</P>
<P>
"It is no doubt that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has committed a cover-up of the truth
by her failure to report an illegal immigrant to the authorities concerned,"
Major General Aye Myint, Myanmar's deputy defence minister, told a security
forum in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"Thus there was no option but to open legal proceedings in accordance with the
law," Aye Myint said. "She permitted him to stay.... She communicated, provided
him food and shelter."
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi has spent 13 of the last 19 years in detention, mostly at her
crumbling lakeside mansion. She was moved to Yangon's notorious Insein prison
and charged on May 14.
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old opposition leader met with her lawyers at the jail on Saturday
ahead of final arguments in the case, which are due to be heard on Friday. A
guilty verdict is widely expected.
</P>
<P>
Her party said Sunday that she was upset that Myanmar authorities had entered
her residential compound without permission to stage a reconstruction of
Yettaw's visit for the purposes of the trial.
</P>
<P>
"Aung San Suu Kyi said she is not completely satisfied as Mr Yettaw and the
authorities went into her compound last week for a demonstration (of how he got
into the property)," party spokesman Nyan Win told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"It was not in accordance with the law. She said it was unjust bullying," added
Nyan Win, who is also part of her legal team.
</P>
<P>
Yettaw, a 53-year-old Mormon and former US military veteran, was arrested on May
6 after swimming to Aung San Suu Kyi's house using a pair of homemade flippers
and spending two nights there.
</P>
<P>
He has told the court that he had had a vision that Aung San Suu Kyi would be
assassinated by "terrorists" and was told by God to warn both the opposition
leader and the Myanmar government.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi said in a statement to the court this week that she could not
be held responsible as the junta had failed to boost security despite her having
reported that Yettaw made a previous visit to the house in November 2008.
</P>
<P>
However Nyan Win quoted the democracy campaigner as saying that she "has no
grudge to Mr Yettaw and his family."
</P>
<P>
International critics accuse Myanmar's military regime of trumping up the
charges in a bid to keep her locked up ahead of elections in 2010, as the latest
six-year period of her house arrest expired on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But in his speech in Singapore, Myanmar's Aye Myint said the case against Aung
San Suu Kyi was an internal matter.
</P>
<P>
"Countries should refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of Myanmar
that will affect peace and security of the region," said Aye Myint.
</P>
<P>
"It is the universal legal principle that no one is above the law," he said
</P>
<P>
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates, speaking at the same forum on Saturday,
pressed Myanmar to free Aung San Suu Kyi and said there needed to be "real
change in Burma". Burma is Myanmar's former name.
</P>
<P>
Ann Taylor, Britain's minister for international defence and security, made a
similar call on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar last week hit back at rare criticism from the normally placid fellow
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) over the treatment
of the democracy campaigner.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, whose country holds the rotating
chairmanship of the 10-member bloc, said ASEAN leaders would discuss Myanmar at
a summit in South Korea on June 1-2.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile more than 100 people rallied in Singapore late Sunday as part of a
regional effort by civil rights groups to press Myanmar's military rulers to
release Aung San Suu Kyi.
</P>
<P>
Similar rallies were also held simultaneously in Indonesia, the Philippines,
Malaysia, Cambodia and Thailand, organisers said.

British PM says won't quit as poll predicts Euro election rout
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown insisted Sunday he would not quit despite a
scandal over MPs expenses and dire poll ratings for his ruling Labour Party
before crunch European and local elections.
</P>
<P>
He said the expenses furore was "appalling" and "offends everything that I
believe in".
</P>
<P>
Every lawmaker would be forced to account for all their expenses from the last
four years, he promised.
</P>
<P>
Some 13 lawmakers from Labour and the main opposition Conservatives have said
they will resign since the scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
The leaked expenses claims have shown that Members of Parliament have claimed
from the public purse for everything from moat cleaning to a duck island.
</P>
<P>
A new Sunday Telegraph/ICM poll suggested that three weeks of revelations by the
Daily Telegraph newspaper would hit Brown hard at the European and local
elections, in which Britons vote Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It suggested Labour would come third in the European elections with just 17
percent, behind David Cameron's Conservatives and second opposition centrist
Liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Even more damagingly, it suggested Labour would also come third in a general
election with just 22 percent of the vote -- the worst Brown's party has done in
an opinion poll since 1987.
</P>
<P>
Some 54 percent of those polled thought Labour had been worst affected by the
expenses scandal, compared to 13 percent for the Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
ICM interviewed 1,013 adults by telephone between May 27-28.
</P>
<P>
But Brown, who must call a general election by the middle of next year,
dismissed suggestions he could step down to make way for a more popular leader
in an interview with BBC television.
</P>
<P>
"Things go up and down," he said. "We're going through the most difficult
economic circumstances the country has faced.
</P>
<P>
"People are angry rightly because they are worried when they see taxpayers'
money wasted on their MPs and they're finding it very difficult... in a
difficult economic situation," he added, referring to Britain's recession.
</P>
<P>
He also said he wanted to introduce a "constitutional renewal" bill and was
looking at reforms including the case for a written constitution, lowering the
voting age to 16 and reform of the unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
Brown said he did not accept the case for an unelected House of Lords and said
he was always open to arguments for reforming of the voting system.
</P>
<P>
Cameron, meanwhile, renewed his calls for a snap general election, telling the
BBC the public wanted to "sit in judgement on MPs".
</P>
<P>
Turnout at European elections in Britain is usually low -- in the last polls in
2004, it was just 38 percent, due in part to strong Eurosceptic sentiment among
many.
</P>
<P>
This time, fringe parties such as the anti-EU UK Independence Party and the far-
right British National Party are expected to benefit. Commentators say the BNP
could even win its first seat at the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
An Economist magazine/YouGov poll last week found that only 31 percent of
Britons think its membership of the European Union is a good thing, compared to
37 percent who think it is bad.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,322 adults in Britain were questioned between May 22 and May 26.

Zimbabwe PM's party says central bank chief must resign
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HARARE, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's party bemoaned the slow pace of change in
Zimbabwe's fledgling coalition on Sunday, calling for the central bank chief and
attorney general to quit immediately.
</P>
<P>
In resolutions at the end of its annual conference, the Movement for Democratic
Change also called for a regional summit to resolve differences dogging the
unity government between Tsvangirai and President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
The MDC has long criticised Mugabe's decision to retain central bank chief
Gideon Gono and attorney-general Johannes Tomana but Tsvangirai tried to take
the heat out of the issue last week when he said their future should be decided
by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), a regional bloc.
</P>
<P>
However in the resolutions, the MDC said both men should go immediately.
</P>
<P>
"Aware of the conflict and divisive effect of the issues ... conference calls
that in the national interest Johannes Tomana and Gideon Gono resign forthwith,"
the MDC said in resolutions read by secretary-general Tendai Biti, who is also
Zimbabwe's finance minister.
</P>
<P>
Tsvangirai encountered tough resistance within the MDC about entering a power-
sharing deal with Mugabe in February and the resolution made clear the party is
unhappy about what it sees as a lack of reform and continued intimidation of its
supporters by pro-Mugabe militias.
</P>
<P>
The government must address "the slow pace of media reforms, slow implementation
of the government 100-day plan, continued deployment of the military in villages
and the existence of militia and ghost workers on the government payroll," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The MDC is particularly keen to see the back of Gono, who has been widely
criticised for failing to stop the Zimbabwean economy's freefall and slide into
world record inflation.
</P>
<P>
Tomana is also accused of having overseen politically-inspired prosecutions in
the aftermath of last year's disputed presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Tsvangirai won the first round of voting in March last year but pulled out of a
run-off after scores of MDC were killed in attacks the party blamed on Mugabe's
followers.
</P>
<P>
The conference also called on the inclusive government to support victims of
political violence.
</P>
<P>
"Concerned with the plight of victims of political violence ... conference
resolves that the inclusive government vigilantly addresses the issue of the
welfare of victims," the party said.

Tennis: Azarenka dethrones Queen Ana at French Open
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Belarussian teenager Victoria Azarenka sunk Ana Ivanovic's hopes of defending
her French Open crown with a comprehensive 6-2, 6-3 win in the fourth round on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time the 19-year-old has reached the last eight at a Grand Slam
event and she will play Russian top seed Dinara Safina for a place in the semi-
finals.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Ivanovic, meanwhile, was left pondering what she has to do to
re-discover the form that brought her the title and world No.1 spot a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Azarenka, with three titles to her name this year already, was the first to
break thanks to a blistering crosscourt backhand in the third game.
</P>
<P>
Ivanovic, who has battled for form and fitness since her triumph here last year,
had her chances to break back in the following game but failed to take them.
</P>
<P>
She paid the penalty for that three games later when Azarenka collected a second
break of serve forcing her opponent to hit long on break point at the end of a
long, punishing rally.
</P>
<P>
Azarenka, a former world junior No.1, comfortably served out for the set despite
opening with a double fault.
</P>
<P>
Both players were wearing high-tech strapping on their knees, the right for
Ivanovic and the left for Azarenko, a clear sign of the injury epidemic that has
beset women's tennis.
</P>
<P>
Ivanovic was put under severe pressure on her serve again at the start of the
second set and after saving a handful of break points she finally succumbed by
hitting a forehand a fraction long.
</P>
<P>
That was all Azarenka needed to further assert her authority in the match with
Ivanovic looking increasingly out of sorts and unsure of herself.
</P>
<P>
The crowd were firmly behind the Serb, but it made no difference as Azarenko
jumped out into a commanding 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Ivanovic did manage to claw two games back to get to 4-2, but Azarenka snuffed
out any hope she had of a comeback by breaking the Serbian's serve again in the
next game.
</P>
<P>
She failed to serve out for the match but broke Ivanovic for the sixth time in
the match in the following game to go through.

Kuwait opposes high oil price

kuwait city, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kuwait's Oil Minister Sheikh Ahmad Abdullah al-Sabah said on Sunday the OPEC
member does not favour a high price for oil because this would dampen the global
economy.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in favour to see the prices in the hundreds (of dollars a barrel)
because this will fuel recession again," the minister told reporters outside
parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said Kuwait, the fourth largest Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries
producer, is happy with OPEC's decision to keep production unchanged and ruled
out any output cut when the organisation meets again in September.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the recent increase in oil prices, Sheikh Ahmad said: "The market is
reacting to sentiment rather than fundamentals. There is a lot of supply but the
prices are rising."
</P>
<P>
The minister expects prices to increase to around 70 dollars a barrel as winter
appoaches. "We are approaching winter and definitely demand will increase."
</P>
<P>
Last July oil prices surged above 147 dollars a barrel before plunging to barely
32 dollars in December.
</P>
<P>
Continuing their recent recovery, prices shot back above 66 dollars a barrel on
Friday on further signs of economic recovery and a weakening of the US currency.
</P>
<P>
New York's main futures contract, light sweet crude for delivery in July ended
at 66.31 dollars, while Brent North Sea closed at 65.52 dollars.

Palestinian tensions flare in deadly shoot-out
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NABLUS, West Bank, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six people were killed in a West Bank shoot-out on Sunday when an attempt to
arrest a senior Hamas commander went awry, deepening the rift between the two
main Palestinian factions.
</P>
<P>
The Islamist Hamas movement ruling the Gaza Strip warned that the rival Fatah
group loyal to president Mahmud Abbas had crossed a "red line" over the killing
of one of its top fighters in the arrest operation.
</P>
<P>
The firefight erupted when Palestinian police dominated by Fatah tried to arrest
Mohammed al-Samman, commander of Hamas's armed wing in the northern West Bank,
who was also on Israel's wanted list.
</P>
<P>
Samman barricaded himself into a house in the town of Qalqiliya in the north of
the Israeli-occupied territory together with Mohammed Yassin, another Hamas
militant, police and Hamas said.
</P>
<P>
The ensuing shoot-out killed both Hamas men, three Palestinian policemen and a
civilian. A curfew was imposed on the town near the border with Israel following
the incident, police said.
</P>
<P>
Hamas branded the incident a "red line" and said it laid "complete
responsibility of this ugly crime on Abbas and his security forces."
</P>
<P>
Describing Abbas and his forces as agents of arch-enemy Israel, Hamas said in a
statement that it would respond "with acts," without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
"There is no difference between the occupation who shoots and the people who
carry out their missions for them," a spokesman for Hamas's armed wing said at a
news conference in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The deep-seated rivalries between Hamas and Fatah boiled over in June 2007 when
the Islamists violently seized control of Gaza, causing a split in Palestinian
ranks that has become a key stumbling block in efforts to reach Middle East
peace.
</P>
<P>
Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhum said there was no chance of further reconciliation
talks with Fatah after the "escalation by security services of Abu Mazen and
Fatah against Hamas and its leaders in the West Bank."
</P>
<P>
"Fatah should choose -- dialogue with us or doing the dirty work of the Zionist
enemy," Barhum said as Hamas decried the killing over mosque loudspeakers in
Gaza City.
</P>
<P>
A senior official from the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority dismissed the Hamas
accusations as "lies."
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian Authority has one duty -- to impose security and the law and we
will not allow what happened in Gaza to happen here in the West Bank under any
circumstances," he said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Palestinian security forces, Adnan Damiri, defended the arrest
operation.
</P>
<P>
"We in the Palestinian security branches are not a political force. We are
security. We will not allow any Palestinian party to have guns and threaten
civilians."
</P>
<P>
Damiri also said that during the arrest, police discovered Hamas leaflets
containing "incitement against the Palestinian Authority and against the
Palestinian security branches."
</P>
<P>
"We consider what happened today as very dangerous," he said. "It was an attempt
to destroy any hope of resuming the (reconciliation) dialogue."
</P>
<P>
Abbas's power base has been limited to the occupied West Bank since Hamas ousted
his Fatah party from the Gaza Strip, which remains under a crippling Israeli
blockade.
</P>
<P>
The rival factions held five rounds of talks under Egyptian mediation in an
attempt to reconcile but to no avail, and each side frequently accuses the other
of launching campaigns of persecution.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians are pessimistic about the two sides reconciling, with 51 percent
saying that unity between Gaza and the West Bank will happen only after a long
time and 27 percent saying the split is permanent, said a poll released on
Sunday by the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research (PSR).
</P>
<P>
Rights group Amnesty International has lambasted both Hamas and Fatah for
arbitrary detentions, torture and suppression of freedom of speech in their
respective areas of control.
</P>
<P>
On May 20 the Western-backed Abbas swore in a new Palestinian cabinet that
includes members of Fatah but not Hamas, further widening the sectarian rift.

<P>
Indian police are probing the death of an Australian man whose corpse was found
in a guesthouse in the lawless eastern state of Bihar, authorities said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The body of 52-year-old Melbourne resident Michael David was found on Sunday
afternoon in a guest house 15 kilometres (9 miles) from the state capital of
Patna, police said.
</P>
<P>
"Authorities of the guest house alerted the police as Michael did not open the
door. We broke the door and found him dead," police inspector Chandra Prakash
told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The body has been sent for post-mortem examination and the Australian embassy
has been informed about the incident, he said.
</P>
<P>
Police said the man had been staying in the guest house since May 29 and had
arrived in India on May 16 on a tourist visa.
</P>
<P>
Caste and religion-based strongmen along with Maoist rebels have almost free
reign in Bihar, where at least 5,000 murders and 12,000 abductions take place
every year, according to police figures.

Execs urge "exit strategy" for auto takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With bankruptcy and a government takeover looming for auto giant General Motors,
three prominent US business leaders cautioned Sunday that the government should
get out of corporate boardrooms as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
"I think all of us understand the need for the government to intervene and take
the actions they did," said Anne Mulcahy, chief executive of Xerox. "But I also
think there's a need for an exit plan."
</P>
<P>
General Motors was poised to file for bankruptcy protection as early as Monday
when a deadline imposed by the administration of President Barack Obama for
submitting a viable restructuring or declare bankruptcy comes due.
</P>
<P>
A government rescue plan for GM could put as much as 72.5 percent of the
country's biggest automaker under state ownership. Chrysler already has led the
way to bankruptcy courts.
</P>
<P>
The CEOs interviewed on NBC television's Sunday talk show said GM should use the
bankruptcy courts and a government bailout to dramatically restructure, shedding
labor costs and excess capacity to emerge stronger, leaner and more competitive.
</P>
<P>
But they also expressed concern about the longer-term implications of government
control of the auto giants.
</P>
<P>
"I think that's fundamentally unhealthy," said Jim Owens, chief executive of
Caterpillar. "The federal government needs to be in and out."
</P>
<P>
"They need to help get the restructuring done. But I think, fundamentally, the
American public, I think they want to choose the best vehicle, the best car. And
American manufacturers need to be focused on competing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Google's Eric Schmidt noted that the US stimulus package was designed to cover a
two year period.
</P>
<P>
"It's very important that government get out of business and let business do its
thing," he said. "The most important thing to remember, I think, is that jobs,
wealth, are created in the private sector. That's about capitalism."
</P>
<P>
"The other thing that has to happen is you've got to change the rules so we
don't end up with all these organizations that are too big to fail again," he
said. "We've done a fine job bailing them out.  Let's only do this once per
lifetime."
</P>
<P>
He said the auto companies are going to be "highly incentivized to get all that
government money back out."
</P>
<P>
"Because the last thing you want is the government in your board room telling
you what to do," he said.

Football: Milan give Maldini perfect send-off
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Rome, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AC Milan booked their place in the Champions League group stages and gave Paolo
Maldini a winning send-off as they beat Fiorentina 2-0 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The seven-time European champions risked missing out on a top three finish and
having to negotiate two qualifying rounds in Europe next season if they lost but
goals from Kaka and Pato were enough to secure a win and third place in Serie A.
</P>
<P>
Fiorentina finished fourth following the defeat and will play those two
qualifying rounds next season while Juventus claimed second spot with a 2-0 home
win over Lazio.
</P>
<P>
But while Maldini was afforded a great reception from both sets of fans in
Florence to celebrate his 24 years as a Milan player, coach Carlo Ancelotti made
what will likely be a more discreet departure.
</P>
<P>
He too is likely to leave Milan to join Chelsea next season, despite Milan's
fans chanting for him to stay throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
Fiorentina, who had to win to take a top three finish, started brightly and
former Milan forward Alberto Gilardino got on the end of a left-wing cross on
22-minutes but headed wide under pressure.
</P>
<P>
Just two minutes later former Arsenal star Mathieu Flamini grazed the bar with a
vicious shot from 22 yards as Milan demonstrated their potency.
</P>
<P>
Fiorentina had a good shout for a penalty on 42 minutes when Giuseppe Favalli
appeared to haul down Gilardino but the referee gave a foul the other way.
</P>
<P>
On 48 minutes the striker went close again as he curled a shot just past the
post with the outside of his right boot.
</P>
<P>
But on 55 minutes Milan took the lead with a simple move as Andrea Pirlo
released Gianluca Zambrotta down the right and although his cross was blocked by
Alessandro Gamberini, Kaka followed up to slide home the ball.
</P>
<P>
Filippo Inzaghi should have finished things on 62 minutes but he blazed over the
bar with only French goalkeeper Sebastien Frey to beat.
</P>
<P>
However substitute Pato did seal the victory on 76 minutes as he beat the
offside trap and then chipped Frey as the Frenchman went to ground.
</P>
<P>
Champions Inter Milan came back from 3-2 down to beat Atalanta 4-3 at the San
Siro as Portugal veteran Luis Figo also bowed out from the game.
</P>
<P>
Sweden forward Zlatan Ibrahimvoic also took the golden boot award after his two
goals took his tally to 25 this season.
</P>
<P>
Czech veteran Pavel Nedved was another player departing as he played his final
game for Juventus, with two Vincenzo Iaquinta goals securing their victory.
</P>
<P>
Torino joined Reggina and Lecce in being relegated to Serie B after they lost
3-2 at AS Roma and Bologna won 3-1 at home to Catania.

Mideast peace higher priority than Iran nuclear aims: Egypt
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Cairo, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is more important to Egypt than
confronting Iran's nuclear programme, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
spokesman Suleiman Awad said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes US President Barack Obama will address in his speech from
Cairo on Thursday the "essence of the Islamic world's relations with the US...
and that is peace in the Middle East," Awad said.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt and President Mubarak's priority is the Palestinian cause," state news
agency MENA quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to what he called "Israeli media reports" of Israel and Arab
countries being equally threatened by Iran's nuclear programme.
</P>
<P>
Israel along with main ally Washington suspects Iran of trying to develop atomic
weapons under the guise of a civilian nuclear programme, a charge Tehran has
repeatedly denied.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the most populous Arab country with a mostly Sunni Muslim population, has
repeatedly accused Islamist Shiite Iran of trying to control the region.
</P>
<P>
Egypt shares a border with the Palestinian enclave Gaza ruled by the Islamist
Hamas movement. It has attempted to broker Palestinian reconciliation talks and
a prisoner exchange between Hamas and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Government officials interpreted Obama's choice of Cairo as a venue for his
speech to the Muslim world as confirmation of the continuing influence of the
country, once a regional powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has come under criticism from other Arab countries, especially Syria and
Qatar, over its policies towards Hamas and its decision to partially enforce a
blockade on the Gaza Strip.

Cuba agrees to resume talks with US on migration, mail: US
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cuba has agreed to resume talks with the United States on migration and direct
mail, a US official said here Sunday, as a US-Cuban thaw gathers pace under
President Barack Obama's administration.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton prepared to attend
Tuesday's Organization of American States (OAS) general assembly in Honduras,
where Washington and its southern neighbors have been caught in a row over the
pace of normalization with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government informed Washington on Saturday that it "would like to
resume migration talks.... (and) engage in talks on direct mail service," the
senior State Department official told reporters on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
"We and the Cubans have to determine a mutually convenient place and time," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The official said the Cubans "also indicated they would like to explore areas of
additional dialogue," such as in counter-narcotics, counter-terrorism, hurricane
and disaster preparedness response.
</P>
<P>
US officials said May 23 that the Obama administration had proposed to resume
the discussions on migration issues, which had been conducted every two years
until they were suspended in 2003 by former president George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
It was also Washington that recently proposed to resume direct mail, the
official said, adding mail has for years, if not decades, been sent between the
United States and Cuba through a third country.
</P>
<P>
The official called the moves a "very positive development and step forward" as
the Obama administration pursues engagement with Cuba, which has been under a
decades-old US embargo.
</P>
<P>
He said diplomatic notes were handed to US officials by Jorge Bolanos, the head
of the Cuban interests section in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Cuba has a longstanding interest in seeing migration dialogue progress. The
Caribbean nation of more than 11 million is bothered by embarrassing illegal
emigration by Cubans across the shark-infested Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
Havana, the Americas' only one-party communist regime, has long argued the
United States should increase its number of standard legal immigration visas for
Cubans.
</P>
<P>
Since coming to office in January, the Obama administration has called past US
policy a failure and moved to repair ties with Cuban President Raul Castro, who
officially took over the reins from older brother Fidel last year.
</P>
<P>
In April, Obama lifted travel and money transfer restrictions on Cuban-Americans
with relatives in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the announcement would affect the OAS meeting on Tuesday in San
Pedro Sula, the official said "it is hoped that this will be understood in the
region in a positive way."
</P>
<P>
US officials earlier declined to even rule out the possibility of Clinton's
skipping the OAS meeting altogether if negotiators fail to agree on terms for
bringing Cuba back within the 35-member organization's fold.
</P>
<P>
The United States wants Cuba to free political prisoners and respect political
freedoms for it to participate fully in the OAS, saying Havana should be held to
the democratic principles enshrined in the 2001 OAS charter.
</P>
<P>
Other OAS members say that Cuba can be nudged toward democracy once part of the
international body.
</P>
<P>
Since a popular Obama took office in January, he has raised hopes among many of
his southern neighbors that he will soon lift the controversial embargo, even if
he insists that Cuba first undertake democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a complicated challenge for her (Clinton) to deal with,"
said Michael Shifter, an analyst for the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington
think tank.
</P>
<P>
"I sense the Obama people are a little bit nervous. I think they're aware that
it's a minefield, Cuba," said Shifter.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was preparing to leave Sunday for El Salvador to attend Monday's
inauguration of Mauricio Funes, the first stop on a two-country tour.

ICRC 'gravely concerned' at Pakistan's Swat Valley situation
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senior Red Cross officials said Sunday they were "gravely concerned" over the
humanitarian situation in Pakistan's Swat Valley, where the army has been
fighting Taliban fighters for a month.
</P>
<P>
"The organization is gravely concerned about the plight of civilians in Swat and
believes their situation demands a prompt and comprehensive humanitarian
response," said a statement released from the ICRC's Geneva headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Swat need greater humanitarian protection and assistance
immediately," said Pascal Cuttat, head of the organization's delegation in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"The ICRC will do its utmost to meet those needs without delay," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Given what we have already seen on the ground, we are mobilizing additional
resources, but safe and unimpeded access to the area remains essential for our
teams to deliver."
</P>
<P>
Aid workers had been alarmed at what they saw when they entered the region, said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
"People have been blocked for weeks," said Daniel O'Malley, who led the IRCR
team into the region.
</P>
<P>
"There is no running water, no electricity, and food is scarce," he added.
</P>
<P>
"There is no fuel left for generators and most medical facilities in the
district are no longer functioning.
</P>
<P>
"Phone lines are down, so people have been cut off from the outside world and
are anxious for contact with relatives who fled the area," he added.
</P>
<P>
Red Cross workers were also disturbed at conditions in Khwazakhela hospital, one
of the few medical facilities left in Swat, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The handful of hospital staff left are struggling to work without any water,
electricity or supplies," said O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
"They simply cannot cope with the influx of patients."
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross evacuated 14 patients from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's defence secretary said Sunday that fighting in the region could be
over in a few days.
</P>
<P>
Swat valley's main town Mingora is back in government hands, the military
announced late Saturday, and security officials said they were now pursuing the
top leadership of the hardline Taliban movement into the nearby mountains.

585 Franco symbols still on Spanish public buildings: report
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Madrid, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 600 symbols of the right-wing dictatorship of General Francisco Franco
still adorn public buildings in Spain more than 30 years after his death, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the remaining 585 symbols of the regime are on defence
ministry buildings as many military leaders are reluctant to have them removed,
said the daily newspaper Publico, citing a government report.
</P>
<P>
Under a law passed in 2007 by the governing Socialists, towns are obliged to
remove public symbols of the Franco era and rename streets named after the
dictator or the generals who fought with him in Spain's 1936-1939 civil war.
</P>
<P>
But it allows for exceptions to be made if valid artistic, historical or
religious reasons are given for a symbol to remain in place.
</P>
<P>
The government report cited by Publico was drawn up to determine which symbols
of the regime should be "removed, hidden or neutralised" and which should be
allowed to remain.
</P>
<P>
The Franco symbols that remain are mostly depictions of the coat of arms of the
regime, which include the Eagle of St John.
</P>
<P>
The last public statue of Franco still on display on mainland Spain was taken
down from a central square in the northern city of Santander in December 2008.
</P>
<P>
Franco ruled Spain with an iron fist from 1939 until his death in 1975 at the
age of 82, which paved the way for the country's return to democracy.

Tennis: Murray, Gonzalez to clash in French Open quarter-finals
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andy Murray reached his first French Open quarter-final on Sunday where he will
face big-hitting Fernando Gonazalez who almost missed Roland Garros due to a
freak injury caused by signing autographs.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Murray became only the third British man in the Open era to reach the
last eight here with a convincing 7-5, 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 win over Croatia's Marin
Cilic.
</P>
<P>
The ever-improving 22-year-old, with former two-time Roland Garros finalist Alex
Corretja helping hone his claycourt game, looked in impressive physical
condition with a series of long, punishing rallies eventually telling on the
13th seeded Cilic, the youngest man left in the draw.
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing well." said Murray. "You don't reach the French Open quarter-finals
without playing well.
</P>
<P>
"I've had a good claycourt season. I reached the quarters in Monte Carlo and
Madrid and now the last eight here. It's better than previous years but I will
try to keep on improving."
</P>
<P>
Cilic, who came into the fourth round having lost the fewest number of games of
any player in the last 16, was wilting by the time he slipped 0-3 down in the
third set.
</P>
<P>
He needed treatment on his left leg after falling awkwardly before Murray went
on to secure a convincing victory in the seventh game.
</P>
<P>
Chilean 13th seed Gonzalez revealed how an injury signing autographs almost
shattered his French Open dreams.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old, who outgunned Romania's Victor Hanescu 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 to reach
the Roland Garros quarter-finals for the third time, injured his ankle while
signing photos and tennis balls for fans at the Rome Masters in April.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he spent a month on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
"I was signing autographs and someone called me from the other side of the court
and when I ran over to them, I twisted my ankle," said Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
"I think I only managed to sign two and then I had to go back to the locker room
because my ankle was so painful."
</P>
<P>
The freak accident meant Gonzalez had to skip the rest of the claycourt season
to recover in time for the French Open.
</P>
<P>
But despite the Rome scare, he believes he is now playing some of the best
tennis of his 10-year career.
</P>
<P>
"I think on average I am playing my best," said Gonzalez who made the semi-
finals in Rome where he was defeated by Rafael Nadal before being completely
finished off by his injury.
</P>
<P>
"I have played at a good level almost in every match. I enjoy going onto the
courts and into practice although as I am getting older I tend to practice less
but with more intensity."
</P>
<P>
Later Sunday, defending champion and top seed Rafael Nadal tackles Sweden's
Robin Soderling for a place in the last eight.
</P>
<P>
Nadal beat Soderling for the loss off just one game in Rome last month.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other last 16 tie, Russian 10th seed Nikolay Davydenko, twice a
semi-finalist, faces Spanish eighth seed Fernando Verdasco who is looking for a
first quarter-final place.

Russian opposition leader arrested at Moscow demo

MOSCOW, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police arrested Russian radical leftist leader Eduard Limonov and up to 20 other
activists at an unauthorised anti-government demonstration in Moscow, said an
AFP journalist at the scene.
</P>
<P>
Riot police arrested Limonov as soon as he arrived at the Triumphalnaya Square,
where the protest against Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin had been due to
take place.
</P>
<P>
A small group of demonstrators had shouted, "Liberty for political prisoners,"
before being arrested.
</P>
<P>
A police officer cited by the Ria Novosti agency said about 30 people had been
arrested  for having tried to block Tverskaya Street, a main road in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Several opposition groups had turned up for the protest, including Limonov's
National Bolshevik Party and the Solidarnost movement led by former Chess world
champion Garry Kasparov. They were calling for Putin to resign.
</P>
<P>
"The mayor did not authorise the demonstration," Sergei Aksionov, one of its
organisers, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Limonov intends to stand in the 2012 presidential election," he added.
</P>
<P>
Police sealed off the square with about 40 police buses and several hundred
police officers were mobilised for the event.

Danish Tiananmen sculptor denied entry to Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong Kong, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Danish sculptor who flew to Hong Kong to protest the bloody crackdown on pro-
democracy protests in Beijing 20 years ago has been refused entry to the city,
an official and a legislator said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Jens Galschiot, whose sculpture commemorating those who died in the 1989
military crackdown, "Pillar of Shame," is displayed at Hong Kong University, was
stopped by officials Saturday, an immigration spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Albert Ho, the chairman of the Democratic Party and a lawyer, said the Dane was
detained for five hours before being put on a flight to Zurich late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Galschiot, who was also refused entry to the city ahead of the Beijing Olympics
last year, had planned to join the annual June 4 vigil to mark the anniversary
of the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
In Copenhagen, the sculptor told AFP he thought his being turned back from Hong
Kong was retaliation by China for the visit by Tibet's exiled spiritual leader
the Dalai Lama in Denmark.
</P>
<P>
"I was supposed to exhibit two bronze sculptures in Hong Kong in remembrance of
the 20th anniversary of the bloodly crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen
Square," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he was held by police for about eight hours before being "escorted by
two dozen agents to the entrance of the plane" which took him to Copenhagen,
where he arrived Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
He says the only reason he was given for being denied entry to Hong Kong --
although his two sons and a filmmaker with him were allowed into the former
British colony -- was "questions of immigration".
</P>
<P>
"This denying me entry without valid reasons shows that Hong Kong, which has a
particular status within China and larger freedom, obeys orders from Beijing,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Ho, who had been allowed to see Galschiot during his detention, said: "We are
looking at the possibility of legal action following the decision."
</P>
<P>
The immigration department spokesman said it had acted in accordance with the
law.
</P>
<P>
The 20th anniversary of the crackdown on the protests -- which left hundreds,
possibly thousands, dead across the Chinese capital -- will be marked on
Thursday in Hong Kong with a candlelight vigil expected to draw tens of
thousands.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, which has a different legal system from the mainland, is the only
place in China where the anniversary is publicly commemorated.

Kuwait ruler urges end to political crises
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
KUWAIT CITY, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kuwaiti emir opened on Sunday the new parliament, calling on lawmakers to
end political turmoil that has rocked the oil-rich Gulf state and focus on
economic development.
</P>
<P>
"We must overcome this phase with all its ramifications and open a new page to
build the nation," the emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, told the new
parliament which was elected on May 16 in snap polls.
</P>
<P>
The election, the third in the past three years, was called after the emir
dissolved the previous parliament following a standoff between MPs and the
government.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Sabah said that the cornerstone for forging ahead with stalled
development programmes is through a strong cooperation between the government
and the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Four women made history when they won seats for the first time in the 50-member
parliament, while the election saw the Sunni Islamists reduced to a minority.
</P>
<P>
Three Islamist MPs raised objections when two female MPs and a minister showed
up at the inaugural session without the hijab, or head cover, accusing them of
violating the election law that requires women to abide by Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Nasser Mohammad al-Ahmad al-Sabah, a nephew of the emir,
said his government wants to cooperate with the new parliament to get the
country back on development track.
</P>
<P>
But even before new MPs and ministers took the oath, 14 lawmakers walked out of
the session in protest against the government's failure to submit its programme
and a delayed five-year development plan.
</P>
<P>
Deputy premier for economic affairs Sheikh Ahmad Fahad al-Sabah later told
reporters that the government will submit the main guidelines of the five-year
plan next month.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government will push for the approval of several economic bills
including a privatisation draft law that has been in parliament since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Wealthy businessman Jassem al-Khorafi was unanimously elected speaker for a
record fifth consecutive time.
</P>
<P>
The new parliament is due to vote next week on a multi-billion dollar economic
stimulus bill which was issued by the previous government when parliament was
dissolved.
</P>
<P>
Several MPs have vowed to vote against the legislation, charging that public
money was being used to bailout rich people only, ignoring the poor.
</P>
<P>
A group of MPs submitted a draft law calling on the state to purchase billions
of dollars of consumer loans for citizens and then reschedule them without
interest.
</P>
<P>
Parliament also formed a special committee entrusted to resolve the issue of
over 100,000 bidoons, or stateless Arabs, who are living in the emirate but are
deprived of their basic rights like education and work.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, which says it sits on 10 percent of global crude reserves, pumps about
2.2 million barrels of oil daily. It has 1.1 million of native population
besides 2.35 of foreign residents.

London's Big Ben ticks over to 150th anniversary
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Big Ben, arguably the world's most famous clock which towers over London, marked
its 150th anniversary Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The clock started ticking on May 31 1859 and has continued with only occasional
interruptions for maintenance, bad weather and even bird strikes ever since.
</P>
<P>
The clock, housed in St Stephen's Tower which adjoins Britain's House of
Commons, is one of the capital's most popular tourist attractions and boasts
some amazing statistics.
</P>
<P>
Each of the four Gothic clock faces is seven metres wide, with a minute hand
over four metres long which travels the equivalent of 190 kilometres per year.
</P>
<P>
A Latin inscription is carved beneath each one -- "Domine salvam fac Reginam
nostrum Victoriam primam" which means: "O Lord, save our Queen Victoria the
First." Queen Victoria was on the throne in Britain at the time.
</P>
<P>
The 96 metre-high tower which houses the clock was built as part of the
rebuilding of the Houses of Parliament by architects Charles Barry and Augustus
Pugin following a major fire in 1843.
</P>
<P>
A competition was opened in 1846 to decide who should build the clock, but it
took seven years to decide a winner.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the winner was named as Edward Dent, who had already made a
chronometer for the HMS Beagle, the ship which carried Charles Darwin on a
worldwide voyage which led him to the theory of evolution.
</P>
<P>
The clock cost 2,500 pounds to build and was completed in 1854 but it was not
installed until the clock tower was finished five years later.
</P>
<P>
Even then, there was a last-minute hitch -- the original cast-iron minute hands
were too heavy and had to be replaced with copper ones.
</P>
<P>
The famous bell chimes -- which are used at the start of many television and
radio news bulletins in Britain -- did not sound for another six weeks
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The name Big Ben originally referred to the bell in the clocktower, but has come
to be used for the tower and the clock as well.
</P>
<P>
It is not entirely clear where the name Big Ben comes from -- some say refers to
Sir Benjamin Hall, an MP at the time, while others claim it was after
heavyweight boxer Benjamin Caunt.

Football: Massoud is hero and villain as holders Sfaxien crash
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JOHANNESBURG, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amir Massoud was the hero and villain as African Confederation Cup holders CS
Sfaxien of Tunisia made a shock fourth round exit this weekend despite a 2-0 win
over Primeiro Agosto of Angola.
</P>
<P>
The club from the Mediterranean town of Sfax entered the second leg at home
needing to wipe out a 2-0 deficit from the first encounter against the military
club in Luanda two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Sfaxien laid siege to the Angolan goalmouth from the kick-off at the 20,000-seat
Tayeb Mhiri Stadium as they sought to clear the final qualifying hurdle and
continue to challenge for a third consecutive title.
</P>
<P>
Primeiro had numerous narrow escapes before finally cracking on the stroke of
half-time when they conceded a penalty that experienced African campaigner Issam
Merdassi converted.
</P>
<P>
Sfaxien continued to squander chances in the second half in pursuit of a
aggregate-levelling second goal before Massoud rescued an increasingly desperate
situation by scoring direct from an 84th-minute free kick.
</P>
<P>
A 2-0 win for the home team meant a shoot-out with five mandatory kicks each and
all were converted except that taken by Massoud, giving the visitors a 5-4
victory on penalties.
</P>
<P>
The exit of Sfaxien means the holders of both African Football Confederation
(CAF) competitions failed to defend their title with Champions League holders
Al-Ahly of Egypt eliminated by international rookies Kano Pillars of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Also through to the group phase of the second-tier African Confederation Cup are
Stade Malien, the first Malian club to reach this stage of a competition that
replaced the African Cup Winners Cup and CAF Cup five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Boosted by a first-minute goal, Malien defeated Al-Ittihad Khemisset of Morocco
3-1 in Bamako having drawn the first leg and qualified 4-2 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Abdoulaye Sidibe put Stade ahead with his first goal of a competition modelled
on the European UEFA Cup, staged for the last time this season and won by
Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk.
</P>
<P>
Adama Toure scored either side of half-time in the Malian capital to put Stade
in a commanding position before Rahhal al-Khaddouri snatched a late consolation
goal for the Moroccans.
</P>
<P>
The other six second leg fixtures will be staged later Sunday with title
favourites Al-Ahly defending a 3-0 advantage over African debutants Santos of
Angola in Luanda.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese coach Manuel Jose will be making his final appearance as Ahly coach
after leading the Cairo 'Red Devils' to 21 domestic and international titles in
two spells at a club that claims 40 million supporters.
</P>
<P>
He takes over 2010 African Nations Cup hosts Angola next month, charged with
transforming a struggling national team into one capable of winning the biennial
showcase of football on the continent.

Iraq's Kurdish region to export oil for first time
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
DOHUK, Iraq, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraq's self-ruled Kurdish region will begin exporting crude oil for the first
time on June 1, piping up to 90,000 bpd to its neighbours in a landmark step for
the area, officials said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Companies chosen by the regional government will pump oil from two Kurdish
fields via an Iraqi pipeline to Turkey with the consent of Baghdad in a step
that could pave the way to ending bitter domestic feuds over Iraq's oil wealth.
</P>
<P>
Initial exports will be around 40,000 barrels per day from the Taq Taq field in
the province of Arbil and another 50,000 bpd from the Tawke field in Dohuk,
company officials told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"Piping of the oil will start Monday morning from the Taq Taq field, pumping it
from seven wells," said Mohammed Okotan, director of the Taq Taq project for
Turkey's Genel Enerji, which is partnered with Calgary-based Addax Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to reach 60,000 barrels a day by the end of this year," said
Okotan, adding that the project aims to double exports in two years.
</P>
<P>
"The quality of the crude is excellent," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the Tawke field, northwest of Taq Taq, Norwegian oil firm DNO will also start
pumping oil for export on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We'll start with 50,000 bpd and we'll see how this operation goes and if we can
increase it," said DNO director of operations Jon Sargent.
</P>
<P>
Exports from Tawke will link with the Iraq-Turkey main export pipeline at the
border town of Fishkhabur, while crude from Taq Taq will be trucked from the
capital Arbil before connecting with the Iraq-Turkey export pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Regional president Massud Barzani will preside over an official ceremony on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Disagreements over oil rights, especially between Baghdad and the Kurdish
government, have held up exploitation of much of Iraq's massive reserves as well
as long-delayed hydrocarbons legislation.
</P>
<P>
Terms of the Taq Taq deal are for Baghdad to receive 88 percent of revenues of
which the Kurd region will get back 17 percent. Genel Enerji and Addax will
share 12 percent, Okotan told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Executives from DNO refused to provide revenue sharing figures, although one DNO
official confided that the terms are quite similar to those in the Taq Taq
field.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly said that it is opposed to Arbil signing its own
contracts, a position which Kurdish officials have thumbed their nose at by
signings dozens of agreements with foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month Kurd officials announced an eight billion dollar plan to
develop Kurdish gas fields with four European and two United Arab Emirates
partners that could later supply the EU's flagship Nabucco pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Oil minister Hussein al-Shahristani responded by calling the deal illegal,
although he has come under heavy criticism for failing to lift the nation's
anaemic oil and gas output as crude prices have plunged.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is in dire need of revenue to rebuild its shattered economy, especially
after oil prices tumbled a peak of 147 dollars a barrel last July to a current
level just above 60 dollars, putting huge pressure on Iraq's budget.
</P>
<P>
The nation derives more than 90 percent of its revenues from the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
Iraq wants pump six million barrels per day, up from its current stated output
of around 2.2 million, within the next four to five years as new projects come
online.
</P>
<P>
The conflict-ravaged country has the world's third largest proven reserves of
oil, with more than 115 billion barrels, behind only Saudi Arabia and Iran.

Breakaway South Ossetia votes for parliament
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TSKHINVALI, Georgia, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rebel Georgian region of South Ossetia voted Sunday in polls expected to
secure the grip of its separatist leader nine months after it was the subject of
war between Russia and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The local opposition says Eduard Kokoity is seeking to use the elections to
forge a loyal parliamentary majority to push through an amendment allowing him
to run again for office when his second term lapses in 2011.
</P>
<P>
Officials estimated the voter turnout at over 70 percent by 4:00 pm (1300 GMT).
According to law, the vote is deemed valid if the voter turnout reached 50
percent plus one vote.
</P>
<P>
Voting was due to end at 1600 GMT, with the first results expected two hours
later.
</P>
<P>
Russia -- which outraged the West by recognising South Ossetia as independent in
the wake of the August war with Georgia --- has said South Ossetia should not
amend the existing term limits in its constitution.
</P>
<P>
Kokoity said, however, it was too early to say whether he planned to run again,
although he did not rule out that possibility.
</P>
<P>
"There are two and half years left till then and a lot left to do. We are
working and working now. I am not thinking about it yet," he said in an
interview with AFP.
</P>
<P>
"With what happened in August we need three to four years to rebuild," Kokoity
said.
</P>
<P>
Four parties are competing for the 34 seats in the parliament, but the central
election commission has barred the only two parties not loyal to Kokoity.
</P>
<P>
Opposition activities said voting would not make a difference. "I plan to sit at
home. There's nothing we can do," said Alan Gassiyev, an opposition leader,
calling the polls "completely illegal."
</P>
<P>
Critics accuse Kokoity, an ex-wrestling champion, of muzzling opponents and
stealing the money sent from Russia.
</P>
<P>
As the reconstruction in the province stalled this winter, the opposition also
accuses the separatist leader and his circle of diverting lorries carrying
construction material and humanitarian aid to traffic the goods in Russia.
</P>
<P>
But despite the slow pace of reconstruction in the republic many praise Kokoity
for his leadership during the August conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Kokoity has done a lot for the people of South Ossetia, he's fought 20 years
for this country," Angela Tedeyeva, a 32-year-old kindergarden teacher, said as
she cast her ballot.
</P>
<P>
"If people are happy with him, they will vote for him again," she said.
</P>
<P>
Georgia ridiculed the vote, with the country's reintegration minister Temur
Iakobashvili saying the elections were "nothing but clownery, a farce and a
redistribution of a criminal power."
</P>
<P>
Kokoity insists the elections were in strict accordance with law, saying the
polls were "a maturity test for the small independent state."
</P>
<P>
He said the large number of voters at the polling stations was proof that the
vote was deemed "genuine" by people.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-eight polling stations have been set up for the region's 50,000 residents
as well as additional sites in Russia for expatriates and refugees from the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
Kokoity's critics are concerned that the high number of polling stations placed
in the villages which were used to be populated by ethnic Georgians and which
are now nearly empty will be used to falsify the election results.
</P>
<P>
Kokoity -- who built connections in Moscow working as a trade official for the
rebel region when it was known as a highway for smuggling in the early 1990s --
has rejected accusations against him as Georgian propaganda.
</P>
<P>
But as the looming political scandal in the region threatens to become an
embarrassment for Moscow, there are signs that the Kremlin is scaling back its
support for the South Ossetian leader.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Naryshkin, the head of the Russian presidential administration, said on
Russian television this month that South Ossetia should not mend the existing
term limits in its constitution.
</P>
<P>
Moscow and Tbilisi fought a brief but intense war last August over the region,
which had enjoyed de facto independence since the early 1990s thanks to tacit
Russian support.
</P>
<P>
Following the conflict Russia formally recognised the region as independent, a
move followed only by Nicaragua.

Troops hunt Taliban as Pakistan says victory near
</HEADLINE>

PESHAWAR, Pakistan, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pakistan's defence secretary said Sunday that a month-long offensive to crush
Taliban fighters in northwest Swat could end within days, as fierce fighting
spilled into a nearby tribal area.
</P>
<P>
Swat valley's main town Mingora is back in government hands, the military
announced late Saturday, and security officials said they were pursuing the
leadership of the hardline Taliban movement into the nearby mountains.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Defence Syed Athar Ali told a security forum in Singapore that
three targeted northwest districts were almost clear of Taliban rebels.
</P>
<P>
"Operations in Swat, Buner and adjoining areas have almost met complete
success," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Only five to ten percent of the job is remaining and hopefully within the next
two to three days these pockets of resistance will be cleared."
</P>
<P>
However, chief military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas told AFP that it was
impossible to estimate when the offensive would end.
</P>
<P>
"The operation is continuing in all of the areas and at this stage we cannot
give any timeframe," he said.
</P>
<P>
The army remains locked in battle in some areas, but the fall of Mingora was a
critical milestone in an offensive launched after the Taliban thrust to within
100 kilometres (60 miles) of Islamabad in April.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's military also reported that 25 militants and seven soldiers were
killed in clashes in South Waziristan near the Afghan border, a bolt-hole for
Taliban and Al-Qaeda-linked militants south of the current army bombardment.
</P>
<P>
"Miscreants attacked a security forces checkpost last night (Saturday) in
Spinkai Raghzai, South Waziristan agency. The attack was repulsed successfully,
inflicting heavy casualties on militants," it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen militants and three soldiers died in the clash in Spinkai Raghzai, while
elsewhere, in the semi-autonomous tribal area 10, insurgents and four troops
including a lieutenant died when rebels attacked a military convoy.
</P>
<P>
Civilians have started fleeing the area fearing a fresh military onslaught, but
the army has denied an imminent assault on Waziristan, where militants branded
by Washington as the greatest terror threat to the West are holed up.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which is firmly backing the current military drive, had
warned that the rebels threatened Pakistan's very existence.
</P>
<P>
Officials have said that lower-ranking Taliban leaders had been killed but it
was harder to get to the top leaders, who had a network of hardcore militants
around them and had slipped into the rugged mountain terrain.
</P>
<P>
"They will be eliminated wherever we find them," said one military official, who
did not wish to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media."We
believe that they are somewhere in the mountains," he added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has slapped a 600,000-dollar price on the head of firebrand Swat
Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah for masterminding the nearly two-year
uprising in the valley to enforce sharia law.
</P>
<P>
The government has also offered rewards for 21 rebel chiefs -- wanted dead or
alive -- from Swat. The military claims to have killed 1,244 militants since the
offensive began, although the numbers are impossible to verify.
</P>
<P>
As the government steps up its campaign to stamp out the militants, fears are
growing of a wave of revenge attacks.
</P>
<P>
The northwestern capital Peshawar and the eastern cultural centre of Lahore have
both been rocked by deadly explosions in the last five days, killing a total of
39 people and wounding hundreds more.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Pakistan Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud has claimed Wednesday's
suicide bombing on a police building in Lahore, and warned of more "massive
attacks" to avenge the Swat military operation.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2.4 million people have fled the current offensive, and the military
relaxed a curfew Sunday in most parts of the northwest including Mingora to
allow people trapped on the roads to return home or leave the region.
</P>
<P>
Senior Red Cross officials said Sunday they were "gravely concerned" over the
situation in Swat Valley.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Swat need greater humanitarian protection and assistance
immediately," said Pascal Cuttat, head of the organization's delegation in
Pakistan, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday, Taliban militants attacked a school in Hangu town south of
Peshawar, killing one administrator and kidnapping three other people, local
policeman Shoukat Hussain said.
</P>
<P>
And in North Waziristan, suspected militants killed a former government doctor
and an Afghan national, officials said.

Activists rally in Singapore to demand Aung San Suu Kyi release
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Singapore, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 100 people rallied in Singapore late Sunday as part of a regional
effort by civil rights groups to press Myanmar's military rulers to release
democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi.
</P>
<P>
The yellow-clad demonstrators observed a minute of silence and released yellow
balloons bearing good wishes for the pro-democracy leader during their gathering
at a park designated as Singapore's free-speech corner.
</P>
<P>
Similar rallies were also held simultaneously in Indonesia, the Philippines,
Malaysia, Cambodia and Thailand, organisers said.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi has spent 13 of the last 19 years in detention, mostly at her
crumbling lakeside mansion after the junta refused to honour elections won by
her political party in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Nobel Peace Prize winner was moved to Yangon's notorious Insein prison and
charged on May 14 for allegedly breaching the terms of her house arrest after
John Yettaw, 53-year-old Mormon and former US military veteran, swam to her home
and stayed there for two nights.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Myanmar's deputy defence minister Major General Aye Myint told a
regional security forum in Singapore that Aung San Suu Kyi had "covered up" the
truth by failing to report Yettaw’s visit.
</P>
<P>
Braema Mathi, one of the organisers of the rally, slammed the Myanmar official's
comments.
</P>
<P>
"It’s devastating that they are alluding to this collusion between her and
Yettaw. They need to look at their own security lapses," Mathi told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"It is my hope that this event will be the beginning of concerted efforts by the
people of ASEAN to write to their governments and lobby for her release," she
said, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
Wunna, a Myanmar citizen working in Singapore, said the Myanmar junta was
"trying to find an excuse" to continue detaining Aung San Suu Kyi.
</P>
<P>
"I don’t see any legal basis in the accusations. It is a sham," said Wunna,
who was at the demonstration but would not give her full name because of fear of
reprisals by the Myanmar government.
</P>
<P>
Singapore allows protests without a permit at the specially designated
Speakers' Corner, otherwise other unauthorised political gatherings are banned.

Israel fumes over US settlement demands
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Jerusalem, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israel refused on Sunday to bow to US calls for a freeze of all settlement
activity in the occupied West Bank, as it fumed over the "unfair" demands that
have raised tensions between the key allies.
</P>
<P>
"I want to say in a crystal clear manner that the current Israeli government
will not accept in any fashion that legal settlement activity be frozen," said
Transport Minister Yisrael Katz, a close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The premier also held firm on Israel's controversial blockade of Hamas-run Gaza
Strip, warning that the Islamists were rearming and that the ceasefire that
ended a 22-day war on January 18 remained very fragile.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu did not himself address the settlements issue during the weekly
cabinet meeting, but Katz's fighting words were echoed by other members of the
largely right-wing cabinet, including from its most liberal party, Labour.
</P>
<P>
A senior Israeli official complained that Washington under President Barack
Obama -- who has vowed to pursue Middle East peace talks as part of a changed
approach to the region -- was placing unfair demands on the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans have demanded almost nothing from the Palestinians but are asking
Israel to take steps that are a real sacrifice. These demands are unfair," he
told AFP on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians are taking a passive approach. They're not even ready to meet
the Israeli side and Abu Mazen (Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas) wants the
Americans to do all the work," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abbas, who met Obama last week 10 days after the US president met Netanyahu, has
vowed that that he will not resume talks unless Israel freezes settlements in
the occupied West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Obama administration has demanded that Israel stop all its activity in the
settlements, including so-called natural growth construction that allows for
building to accommodate a rising population.
</P>
<P>
The unusually blunt talk over one of the top stumbling points in the stalled
Middle East peace process has raised alarm bells that the new US president could
put pressure on Israel as part of his new approach to the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
"This is an unjustifiable demand that the government and the public do not
accept," said Interior Minister Eli Yishai of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party.
</P>
<P>
Social Affairs Minister Isaac Herzog of the centre-left Labour party, the most
liberal in Netanyahu's government, said that "one has to understand that there
are various statuses within the settlements" and "saying that the picture is
black and white or write or wrong is wrong."
</P>
<P>
More than 280,000 Israelis live in settlements dotted throughout the West Bank,
which Israel captured in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
Although the international community considers all settlements to be illegal,
Israel makes a distinction between those built with the state's blessing and
outposts constructed without authorisation.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said he would dismantle outposts, but that it made "no sense" to
ask for a complete freeze of construction.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have also complained that Obama's administration has yet to
say it will honour commitments in a letter that then US president George W. Bush
sent to then Israeli premier Ariel Sharon in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Bush said that given the existence of major settlement blocs in the West Bank it
was "unrealistic" to expect Israel to fully withdraw from the territory as part
of a final peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the settlements, there is stark disagreement between Washington and
Israel over creating a Palestinian state, with Obama repeatedly saying he was
committed to the principle and Netanyahu so far refusing to endorse it in
public.
</P>
<P>
Obama is due in Saudi Arabia and Egypt this week in a bid to reach out to
Muslims and end the deep mistrust of the United States felt across much of the
Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu on Sunday also held firm on maintaining the blockade of Gaza, saying
that "we do not want to strengthen Hamas" by allowing the Islamist group to
rebuild its defences.

<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman leaves for his first official visits
to Russia and Belarus on Monday to discuss Iran and bilateral issues, his
ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Lieberman, a Russian-speaking Soviet emigrant, will meet Russian
President Dmitry Medvedev, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, counterpart Sergei
Lavrov and heads of the Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
He will discuss "political developments and regional threats with his hosts" as
well as bilateral relations, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Topping the agenda for the visit is the issue of Iran's controversial nuclear
programme, a "severe geopolitical threat to Israel and the entire region," it
said.
</P>
<P>
Russia is helping build the first nuclear reactor in the Islamic Republic, which
Israel considers its arch-enemy after repeated statements by President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad calling for the Jewish state to be "wiped off the map."
</P>
<P>
Widely considered to be the Middle East's sole if undeclared nuclear power,
Israel along with main ally Washington suspects Iran of trying to develop atomic
weapons under the guise of a civilian nuclear programme, a charge Tehran has
repeatedly denied.
</P>
<P>
Moscow is seeking a greater role in the Middle East and a Russian foreign
ministry spokesman said on Friday that Russia hopes Lieberman's visit will boost
the country's hopes of hosting a Middle East peace conference this year.
</P>
<P>
The statement from Lieberman's ministry made no mention of the conference idea
but Israel has so far been unenthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
Israel is unhappy about Russia's contacts with the Islamist Hamas movement
ruling the Gaza Strip, an Iranian-backed group pledged to the destruction of the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Russia is the only member of the Quartet -- the European Union, the United
Nations and the United States -- to be formally on speaking terms with Hamas,
classified as a terrorist group by the EU, Israel and the US.
</P>
<P>
During his trip to Damascus a week ago, Lavrov met with Hamas supremo Khaled
Meshaal, telling the Vesti-24 channel later that "we felt a more realistic
assessment of the situation" following the talks with the exiled leader.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov also reiterated that Moscow wanted to see Israel lift a blockade it
slapped on Gaza after Hamas assumed power there in June 2007, saying "we hope
that we can push toward its removal in the foreseeable future."
</P>
<P>
At the time, Israel said it was said it was "deeply disappointed" by the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Following his stay in Russia, Lieberman will travel to Belarus where he will
meet President Alexander Lukashenko and Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on
Thursday in Minsk.
</P>
<P>
It will mark Lieberman's first trip to Russia or Belarus since he was sworn in
as foreign minister along with the rest of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
largely right-wing government on March 31.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman emigrated from Soviet Moldova to Israel in 1978.

Tennis: Murray, Gonzalez to clash in French Open quarter-finals
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andy Murray reached his first French Open quarter-final on Sunday where he will
face big-hitting Fernando Gonazalez who almost missed Roland Garros due to freak
injury caused by signing autographs.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Murray became only the third British man in the Open era to reach the
last eight here with a convincing 7-5, 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 win over Croatia's Marin
Cilic.
</P>
<P>
The ever-improving 22-year-old, with former two-time Roland Garros finalist Alex
Corretja helping hone his claycourt game, looked in impressive physical
condition with a series of long, punishing rallies eventually telling on the
13th seeded Cilic, the youngest man left in the draw.
</P>
<P>
Cilic, who came into the fourth round having lost the fewest number of games of
any player in the last 16, was wilting by the time he slipped 0-3 down in the
third set.
</P>
<P>
He needed treatment on his left leg after falling awkwardly before Murray went
on to secure a convincing victory in the seventh game.
</P>
<P>
Chilean 13th seed Gonzalez revealed how an injury signing autographs almost
shattered his French Open dreams.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old, who outgunned Romania's Victor Hanescu 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 to reach
the Roland Garros quarter-finals for the third time, injured his ankle while
signing photos and tennis balls for fans at the Rome Masters in April.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he spent a month on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
"I was signing autographs and someone called me from the other side of the court
and when I ran over to them, I twisted my ankle," said Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
"I think I only managed to sign two and then I had to go back to the locker room
because my ankle was so painful."
</P>
<P>
The freak accident meant Gonzalez had to skip the rest of the claycourt season
to recover in time for the French Open.
</P>
<P>
But despite the Rome scare, he believes he is now playing some of the best
tennis of his 10-year career.
</P>
<P>
"I think on average I am playing my best," said Gonzalez who made the semi-
finals in Rome where he was defeated by Rafael Nadal before being completely
finished off by his injury.
</P>
<P>
"I have played at a good level almost in every match. I enjoy going onto the
courts and into practice although as I am getting older I tend to practice less
but with more intensity."
</P>
<P>
Later Sunday, defending champion and top seed Rafael Nadal tackles Sweden's
Robin Soderling for a place in the last eight.
</P>
<P>
Nadal beat Soderling for the loss off just one game in Rome last month.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other last 16 tie, Russian 10th seed Nikolay Davydenko, twice a
semi-finalist, faces Spanish eighth seed Fernando Verdasco who is looking for a
first quarter-final place.

Obama may meet pope during July visit to Italy: report

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US President Barack Obama may meet with Pope Benedict XVI in July when he is in
Italy for a Group of Eight summit, the ANSA news agency reported Sunday, without
citing its sources.
</P>
<P>
It would most likely take place as the G8 leaders wrap up their July 8-10 summit
to be held in L'Aquila, the Italian town devastated by an earthquake in April
that killed some 299 people, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
ANSA added that "the most likely date would be July 10, although there has been
no official confirmation."
</P>
<P>
It would the first meeting between the pope and the US leader.
</P>
<P>
Following Obama's victory in the 2008 presidential race, the pope offered his
blessing "that God would support him and the American people, as well as all
people of good will in working for peace, solidarity and justice in the world,"
a Vatican spokesman said at the time.
</P>
<P>
Obama and the leader of the Roman Catholic Church spoke by telephone several
days after the US election.
</P>
<P>
Obama, who is a Christian, is known to support a woman's right to choose an
abortion and is in favour of recognising civil unions for homosexuals -- both
positions strongly opposed by the Vatican.

Rights group slams Niger's 'institutional coup'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LAGOS, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
African rights campaigners on Sunday condemned Niger's president Mamadou Tandja
over his planned referendum on whether to extending his legal term of office,
describing it as "an institutional coup".
</P>
<P>
The international community should put pressure on the president and if
necessary apply sanctions, said Alioune Tine, head of African Defence for Human
Rights (RADDHO) in comments broadcast on Radio France Internationale.
</P>
<P>
"In fact this is an institutional coup," said Tine. "This is the start of a new
chapter of political instability in Niger," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The international community needs to react, as in all coups, initially by
negotiating," said Tine.
</P>
<P>
"And if he (Tandja) does not accept, sanctions need to be imposed."
</P>
<P>
In a broadcast address to the nation on Friday night, Tandja, 71, said he
planned to go ahead with a referendum on a new constitution enabling him to stay
in power after the normal end of his second five-year term.
</P>
<P>
He spoke only days after the country's highest court, the Constitutional Court,
ruled against such a referendum on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Article 49 of the current constitution, which authorises the president to call a
referendum on certain issues, could not serve as a basis for changing the
constitution, it said in its ruling.
</P>
<P>
The day after the court's ruling Tandja dissolved parliament.
</P>
<P>
Tandja, whose tenure should end 22 December, gave no date for the referendum.
</P>
<P>
Washingon expressed its concern on Saturday, a statement from the State
Department warning that it could be "a setback for democracy".
</P>
<P>
Canada also asked the Niger authorities to "respect the spirit and the letter"
of its constitution.

Over 40 injured in protests over Kashmiri women's deaths
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Srinagar, India, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 40 people have been wounded in two days of clashes between Indian
police and Kashmiris demonstrating over the recent deaths of two young Muslim
women, police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Police said they have launched an investigation into the "mystery deaths" of the
women, aged 17 and 22. Their families have accused Indian security forces of
abducting, raping and subsequently killing them.
</P>
<P>
Angry demonstrators on Sunday hurled stones at riot police and paramilitary
forces, who retaliated by firing teargas shells and charging at them with
batons.
</P>
<P>
"Over 40 people, including several policemen, have been wounded in two days of
clashes between police and protesters," a Muslim police officer said, requesting
not to be named.
</P>
<P>
Protesters ransacked a government hospital and a number of other government
buildings after the bodies of the women, who were related, were found on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They were fished out from a shallow stream in Shopian town about 50 kilometres
(31 miles) south of the summer capital Srinagar.
</P>
<P>
Their families said the bodies had marks of violence and their clothes were
torn.
</P>
<P>
An autopsy report will be available on Monday, a police statement said.
</P>
<P>
Indian security forces battling militancy in Kashmir have frequently been
accused of committing human rights violations in the scenic Himalayan region.
Officials say they investigate all the cases and punish those found guilty.
</P>
<P>
Kashmir is in the grip of a nearly 20-year insurgency against Indian rule that
has so far left more than 47,000 people dead by official count.
</P>
<P>
However, violence has dropped sharply since India and Pakistan started a peace
process in January 2004 to resolve pending disputes, including Kashmir, which is
divided between the two countries but claimed in full by both.
</P>
<P>
Senior Kashmir minister Ali Sagar said those involved in the two women's
killings will be "given exemplary punishment."
</P>
<P>
A hardline separatist Syed Ali Geelani has called for a one-day token strike on
Monday to mourn and protest the deaths, a press release said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a policeman and an Indian trooper were killed by militants in two
separate strikes in northern Kashmir's Baramulla district on Sunday, a police
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Rebels also made an unsuccessful attempt on the life of a lesser-known pro-India
leader, Feroz Malik, the police said, without giving further details.

Cuba agrees to resume talks with US on migration, mail: US

WASHINGTON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cuba has agreed to resume talks with the United States on migration and direct
mail, a US official said here Sunday, as tense ties continue to thaw under
President Barack Obama's administration.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton prepared to
travel to the Organization of American States general assembly in Honduras,
where Washington and its southern neighbors are caught in a row over the pace of
normalization with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government informed Washington on Saturday that it "would like to
resume migration talks.... (and) engage in talks on direct mail service," the
senior State Department official told reporters on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
But he said the two governments still have to decide on a time and place.
</P>
<P>
US officials said May 23 that the Obama administration had proposed to resume
the discussions on the thorny issue, which had been conducted every two years
until they were suspended in 2003 by former president George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
The official called the moves a "very positive development and step forward" as
the Obama administration pursues engagement with Cuba, which has been under a
decades-old US embargo.
</P>
<P>
The official said the Cubans "also indicated they would like to explore areas of
additional dialogue," such as in the area of counternarcotics, counter
terrorism, hurricane and disaster preparedness response.

Tennis: Murray reaches French Open quarter-finals
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andy Murray became only the third British man in the Open era to reach the
quarter-finals of Roland Garros on Sunday with a 7-5, 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 win over
Croatia's Marin Cilic.
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded Briton will now tackle three-time quarter-finalist Fernando
Gonzalez, the Chilean 12th seed, for a place in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Ever-improving Murray, 22, has now won four successive matches on clay for the
first time in his career and he looked impressive on Sunday with his physical
fitness proving crucial in a tie of long, punishing rallies.
</P>
<P>
He broke Cilic, whom he had beaten twice in their two previous meetings, in the
opening game and although the tall Croatian hit back immediately, Murray nipped
ahead again in the 11th game on his way to taking the opener 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Breaks were traded again in the seventh and eighth games of the second before
Murray's greater experience told in the tiebreak.
</P>
<P>
Murray was soon a break to the good in the third set against the 20-year-old
Cilic, the youngest player left in the men's draw, whose miserable afternoon got
worse when he needed treatment to his left leg at 0-3 after falling awkwardly.
</P>
<P>
The Scotsman, with a claycourt game honed by the help of former two-time French
Open runner-up Alex Corretja, was soon 4-0 ahead over the wilting Croatian.
</P>
<P>
Cilic, who came into the fourth round having lost the fewest number of games of
any player in the last 16, pulled one break back, surrendered it to trail 1-5
before Murray secured a convincing victory in the seventh game.

Europe's desperate bid to bring out voters
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
brussels, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
European leaders on Sunday stepped up a desperate battle to persuade people to
vote for the EU parliament this week, but the campaign has opened up new
political divisions across the continent.
</P>
<P>
With polls indicating a record low turnout for the June 4-7 election, French
President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a joint
plea to voters, saying a strong parliament was essential to confront the
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders said they want "a strong Europe that protects" its people and
called for "all Europeans to vote" in the statement, published by the Journal du
Dimanche newspaper in France and Die Welt am Sonntag in Germany.
</P>
<P>
A "strong Europe does not necessarily mean more powers for the European Union,
even more European legislation or even more financial means," said Merkel and
Sarkozy.
</P>
<P>
First steps "to assure real European regulation in the financial sector, based
on coordination and cooperation between regulators" should be taken at the next
EU summit in June, they said.
</P>
<P>
"For speculative funds, tax havens, payment for executives and financial
traders, we want an exemplary Europe," they added.
</P>
<P>
The pair also gave strong backing to the Lisbon reform treaty, intended to
streamline EU decision-making but deadlocked by Ireland's rejection in a
referendum last year.
</P>
<P>
"Europe must play a leading role in the world. For that, it must have efficient
institutions. That is why we need the Lisbon Treaty," they said.
</P>
<P>
Merkel and Sarkozy also reaffirmed opposition to Turkey joining the EU, without
naming the country. "To be able to act, the EU needs frontiers. Unlimited
enlargement is not possible."
</P>
<P>
The joint statement highlighted fears that the vote for the 736 member European
assembly could prove a new embarrassment for the 27-nation European Union, after
a record 45 percent abstention at the last election in 2004.
</P>
<P>
In France, a poll for the Le Parisien newspaper Sunday suggested that 55 percent
of the nation's would not bother going to the polls. In Britain, Poland and
Romania, fewer than one in three plan to vote, according to recent surveys.
</P>
<P>
In Spain, which has benefited enormously from EU development funds, political
analysts expect turnout of 40 percent at best. Portugal expects a record
abstention rate.
</P>
<P>
The stakes are higher now, however, as the European Parliament -- the only
directly elected EU institution -- will have a bigger voice in decisions that
affect 500 million Europeans if the Lisbon treaty comes into force.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of voters don't understand what the European Parliament does," said
Philip White, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform think-
tank in London.
</P>
<P>
"You're not voting to keep a government in office or kick it out. The stakes can
seem a little bit less clear than they are in national elections."
</P>
<P>
But in many countries the EU vote will be a test of the national governments in
power, with far-right and left-wing parties expected to benefit from protest
votes and low turnouts in some member states.
</P>
<P>
In Britain, where euroscepticism runs deep, the governing Labour Party is
expected to garner only 16 to 17 percent of the vote, putting it in third place
against the rival Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, weekend polls in the
Times and Sunday Telegraph suggested.
</P>
<P>
Turnout at European elections in Britain is usually low -- in the last polls in
2004, it was just 38 percent, and this time, fringe parties like the anti-EU UK
Independence Party and the far-right British National Party are expected to
benefit.
</P>
<P>
An Economist magazine/YouGov poll last week found that only 31 percent of
Britons think its membership of the European Union is a good thing, compared to
37 percent who think it is bad.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the main opposition Conservatives, David Cameron, has opened up
new divisions in Europe by saying he would withdraw his party from the main
centre-right bloc in the EU parliament, the European People's Party (EPP), and
join a new eurosceptic alliance with Czech and Polish parties.
</P>
<P>
The EPP is still expected to remain the biggest single party in the parliament,
which already has a key role approving the EU budget and passing laws on a wide
range of issues.
</P>
<P>
The parliament will also endorse the new president of the European Commission
after a nomination is made by the EU summit. Jose Manuel Barroso, the
conservative former Portuguese prime minister, is widely expected to get a
second term.

RugbyU: Italy hit by tour withdrawals
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ROME, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Italy's already treacherous tour to Australia and New Zealand has been hit by
the withdrawals of experienced prop Martin Castrogiovanni, scrum-half Simon
Picone and full-back Andrea Marcato.
</P>
<P>
Leicester Tiger Castrogiovanni and Marcato are injured while Picone misses out
due to "personal reasons" according to the Italian Rugby Federation (FIR) on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The absences will hit a squad that is already without full-back Andrea Masi and
hooker Carlo Festuccia as the Metro Racing pair are from the Abruzzo region that
was badly hit by an earthquake in April and they have decided to stay with their
families.
</P>
<P>
Worse still for English-born South African-raised coach Nick Mallett is that
Castrogiovanni is a first choice prop while Picone would likely have started at
number nine.
</P>
<P>
Marcato can play either full-back or fly-half and with Masi out would have
started at number 15.
</P>
<P>
The trio have been replaced by Viadana prop Ignacio Rouyet, fly-half Kristopher
Burton of Prato and the uncapped Parma scrum-half Tito Tebaldi.
</P>
<P>
The squad will meet in Rome on June 1 before leaving for Melbourne two days
later.
</P>
<P>
They face the Wallabies on June 13 in Canberra and then again a week later at
the Etihad Stadium in Melbourne before heading to New Zealand to face the All
Blacks on June 27 in Christchurch.
</P>
<P>
Having lost their last nine matches, including all five in this year's Six
Nations, Mallett knows that he is taking his team into the lion's den.
</P>
<P>
Squad:
</P>
<P>
Forwards (16): Matias Aguero (Saracens/ENG), Mauro Bergamasco (Stade

Football: Apologetic Ashley puts Newcastle up for sale again
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEWCASTLE, England, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ailing English football giants Newcastle were put back on the market by owner
Mike Ashley on Sunday at a vastly lower price than he bought them.
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old businessman is reported by the BBC to be willing to sell the
club for only 80million pounds as opposed to the 135million he paid in 2006.
</P>
<P>
Ashley, a Londoner who has tried to conjure up favour with the Newcastle fans by
wearing Newcastle team shirts and drinking pints of beer among the spectators,
confessed to the Sunday Times that he couldn't wait to leave.
</P>
<P>
"It's been catastrophic for everybody. I've lost my money and made terrible
decisions," he told the Sunday Times.
</P>
<P>
"Now I want to sell as soon as I can. I am genuinely sorry for everybody for
what has happened."
</P>
<P>
Ashley, who went through four managers in the past campaign, again issued a
fulsome apology to the longsuffering Newcastle fans.
</P>
<P>
"I never said I was an expert in football clubs," Ashley added.
</P>
<P>
"I was just a fan - although a very wealthy fan, but I'm not so wealthy now.
</P>
<P>
"I put my money into it and I tried my best, but I accept my best was woefully
short.
</P>
<P>
"Seeing Newcastle relegated has been a catastrophe for us all.
</P>
<P>
"I fully accept that mistakes were made during this and previous seasons, and I
am very sorry for that.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to say sorry to our magnificent supporters who have turned up in
their thousands, home and away, up and down the country and who have given the
team amazing backing throughout.
</P>
<P>
"And I would also say sorry to all of the club's hard-working staff, who have
gone about their jobs all year long."
</P>
<P>
While Ashley is yet to sell the club one of his last acts might be to sign
Newcastle icon Alan Shearer up to a four year contract as manager - though he
only managed one win in his eight matches in charge.

RugbyU: Rising Welsh star Halfpenny set to join Lions
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JOHANNESBURG, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leigh Halfpenny will be on his way to join the British and Irish Lions this week
if he comes through a final kicking session with Cardiff Blues.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old missed the plane to South Africa so that he could receive
intensive physiotherapy at his club to remedy a troublesome thigh strain.
</P>
<P>
He was ordered to work with the Blues medical team to try and overcome the
problem that first ruled him out of his club’s Celtic League clash with
Munster prior to the tour.
</P>
<P>
If he can prove there are no after effects from one final kicking session this
week it is likely the Lions medical team will give him the all-clear to join
them in time for the third game in Bloemfontein Saturday against the Free State
Cheetahs.
</P>
<P>
"Although I haven’t seen Leigh since we were at Pennyhill Park, he is doing
very well by all accounts. He did a very good kicking session on Friday and he
had a day off on Saturday," said Lions doctor James Robson.
</P>
<P>
"He is going to repeat his hared training session and also do some place
kicking. I will be speaking to the Cardiff Blues doctor Geoff Davies about his
reaction to the sessions.
</P>
<P>
"There will be further discussions but, if all goes well, we are looking to
bring Leigh out in the middle of the week."
</P>
<P>
When he does arrive he will raise the Cardiff Blues contingent on tour to five
and complete his dramatic rise from Blues Academy Player of the Year in 2008 to
Lions Test candidate against the world champion Springboks a year later.
</P>
<P>
It has been an incredible 12 months for the man who will become the youngest
member of the Lions squad when he arrives - inheriting the role of mascot
carrier from 21-year-old Munster and Ireland centre Keith Earls.
</P>
<P>
Halfpenny’s Blues team-mate Andy Powell is back in full training after missing
the opening game with a hand injury.
</P>
<P>
His hand swelled after taking a nasty bang and the doctors ordered him to stand
down from the 37-25 victory over the Royal XV so as not to further aggravate the
problem.
</P>
<P>
But he was back in the weights room on Sunday and is expected to be fit to play
if required against the Golden Lions at Ellis Park on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Irish back row man Stephen Ferris, who also pulled out of Saturday's opening
game, is fit for consideration for Wednesday against the Golden Lions.
</P>
<P>
One player who won't be in the running for that game, though, is young Irish
centre Keith Earls, who damaged his right shoulder in the first half at
Rustenburg and will miss training for up to three days.

<TEXT>
<P>
US Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg arrived here Sunday, kicking off a
tour to consult with world powers on negotiations aimed at ending North Korea's
nuclear ambitions.
</P>
<P>
Steinberg, who will later visit other member states of six-way disarmament talks
with Pyongyang -- China, South Korea and Russia, will meet Japanese Foreign
Minister Hirofumi Nakasone on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to having very productive and intensive conversations with the
leadership here to continue our cooperation on a broad range of issues including
the situations in North Korea," he told reporters upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
North Korea withdrew from the talks after the United Nations condemned its April
5 rocket launch and tightened existing sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang went ahead with its second nuclear test on May 25, sparking
international condemnation and leading the Security Council to discuss a new
resolution which could impose new sanctions.
</P>
<P>
North Korea has further fuelled tensions in the past week by launching six
short-range missiles, renouncing the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953
and threatening possible attacks on South Korea.
</P>
<P>
A defiant North Korea also is said to be preparing to launch another long-range
missile.

Football: Japan beats Belgium 4-0 to win Kirin Cup

TOKYO, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Asian champions Japan overwhelmed Belgium 4-0 on Sunday to win the three-
nation Kirin Cup football tournament for a third year running.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese, who defeated Chile 4-0 on Wednesday, ended with two wins for six
points, while Chile and Belgium, who drew with each other on Friday, ended with
one point each.
</P>
<P>
"It is good to win this tournament before going to Uzbekistan (for a World Cup
qualifier next Saturday). I'm glad we made that," said Japan coach Takeshi
Okada.
</P>
<P>
"I just hope we can play solidly against Uzbekistan too. We are determined to
beat (them)."
</P>
<P>
Forward Shinji Okazaki and midfielder Kengo Nakamura connected passes at the
edge of the Belgian area for defender Yuto Nagatomo's goal to open the scoring
in the 21st minute for Japan.
</P>
<P>
Only two minutes later, Wolfsburg forward Yoshito Okubo sent a straight pass to
Nakamura, who fired a right-footer home to put Japan two up.
</P>
<P>
Japan dominated the first half hitting a total of 11 shots on goal with Yasuhito
Endo, Okubo and Wolfsburg midfielder Makoto Hasebe hitting the post or the bar.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, who have played 11 World Cups, managed to hit only one clear shot on
goal in the first half through midfielder Kevin Roelandts, who scored his first
goal in his debut against Chile on Friday. But his shot went wide.
</P>
<P>
The visitors played more aggressively in the second half, but it was again the
home side who scored first when Okubo was free to send a cross from the right to
forward Shinji Okazaki's heading goal in the 60th minute.
</P>
<P>
After Venlo midfielder Keisuke Honda narrowly missed a shot on a free kick in
the 74th minute, Japan made it 4-0 with substitute forward Kisho Yano striking
home on a left cross from Nagatomo in the 77th minute.

Notorcycling: Stoner ends Rossi's seven year reign at Mugello
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SCARPERIA, Italy, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Casey Stoner held off the fast-finishing Jorge Lorenzo to win the Italian Grand
Prix on Sunday and bring to an end Valentino Rossi's seven-year reign here.
</P>
<P>
The Australian also took over the lead in the world championship standings with
his second win of the season having also triumphed in Qatar in the opening race
of the season.
</P>
<P>
He now leads Lorenzo, who started on pole here, by four points in the
championship standings with Rossi third, a further five points back.
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic race that began in wet conditions, Stoner seized the advantage
when switching bikes after 10 laps for a change of tyres.
</P>
<P>
He was the fastest man on the track by some margin in those first few laps after
the switch and although Yamaha pair Lorenzo and Rossi were quickest at the end,
they had both lost too much time and too many places to hit back.
</P>
<P>
Stoner completed the 23 laps in 45min 41.894sec to win by just over a second to
Spaniard Lorenzo.
</P>
<P>
In an exciting race the pole-sitter got off to a terrible start in the wet and
immediately dropped to eighth.
</P>
<P>
Quickest off the mark were Australian Chris Vermeulen, who started 11th, and
Andrea Dovizioso, who began seventh but Stoner passed them both on the long
straight at the beginning of the second lap.
</P>
<P>
Vermeulen quickly started heading backwards, eventually finishing 10th, as Rossi
started to move up from fifth.
</P>
<P>
However Italian Marco Melandri on a Kawasaki, who started 15th on the grid, was
clearly fastest in the wet.
</P>
<P>
Rossi took the lead from Dovizioso, who had got back past Stoner, on the seventh
lap and two laps later he lost that to Melandri.
</P>
<P>
However, on the 10th lap all the front runners came into the pits for a change
of bikes and when they came out, Stoner was quickest to find his pace.
</P>
<P>
Melandri immediately started heading backwards, eventually finishing 11th and
35sec back, while Loris Capirossi propelled himself into race contention with
Stoner and Dovizioso.
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo and Rossi initially struggled with their bikes down in fifth and sixth
and the time they lost over those first three laps coming out of the pits,
essentially cost either of them a chance of victory.
</P>
<P>
While Stoner had soon taken the race lead, both Yamaha riders had to then pass
Melandri, Capirossi and Dovizioso and by the time they had done so, Stoner was
over a second ahead and with only a couple of laps remaining.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile former Superbikes champion James Toseland of Britain got his best
finish of the season in seventh, benefitting from being the first man into the
pits to change his bike.
</P>
<P>
It meant that his tyres were warm and he was flying as the fastest man on track
for a few laps when everyone else was simply trying to get temperature into
their new tyres.

Cricket: Dhoni relishing World Twenty20 after IPL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is looking forward to uniting all the talents
at his disposal during the World Twenty20 in England after competing against his
team-mates in the Indian Premier League.
</P>
<P>
India are the defending World Twenty20 champions after winning the inaugural
edition in South Africa two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Since then the IPL, a lucrative franchise Twenty20 tournament that features the
world's best players, has burst on the scene although this year it was played in
South Africa because of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
"Of course it is a pleasure representing your country after the IPL where you
have limited talent in your side," Dhoni told reporters at Lord's here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"But here we have plenty of options and we have the cream of the IPL so there is
less pressure on each and every individual."
</P>
<P>
India supply more IPL players than any other nation but wicket-keeper batsman
Dhoni, the captain of the Chennai Super Kings, said this was not an advantage in
itself.
</P>
<P>
"The IPL will help us but not only us. There are quite a few players from other
countries but most of our players are in the IPL.
</P>
<P>
"The best thing is that our youngsters will know how to handle pressure, when in
the last over you need 10 or 15 runs, everyone in our side has faced that
situation.
</P>
<P>
"It's good exposure for our guys to play against guys like Brett Lee and Shane
Warne.
</P>
<P>
India have been drawn in Group A alongside Asian rivals Bangladesh - who
defeated India at the 2007 50-over World Cup in the Caribbean and Ireland - who
beat both Bangladesh and Pakistan in the West Indies two years ago.
</P>
<P>
"In Twenty20, there is  no such thing as a weak side, an individual can take the
game away from you," Dhoni explained. "If we take care of the immediate steps,
the result takes care of itself."
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on India's success in South Africa, where they beat arch-rivals
Pakistan in a thrilling final, Dhoni said: "We can't live on or relish the
memories, we have to turn up and do everything from scratch again, it's not
about the past.
</P>
<P>
"Cricket is a very cruel game, the moment you relax is when you are in trouble,"
Dhoni said.
</P>
<P>
Asked how the team had developed, Dhoni joked: "I've got quite a few grey hairs.
That's one change, the plus point is that in the last three years there have
been fewer changes in the side.
</P>
<P>
"The individuals involved have played 80 to 90 one-day internationals, helps me
personally. I can pick ideas according to the situation. Also the fielding has
evolved compared to what it was. We have raised the bar."
</P>
<P>
India, who still have a doubt over the fitness of fast bowler Zaheer Khan's
shoulder injury, come into this event without batting great Sachin Tendulkar.
</P>
<P>
'The Little Master' has opted out of international Twenty20s and Dhoni said:
"He's among the greatest, it's tough, you always want a player like Sachin in
your side.
</P>
<P>
"But he wasn't at the last T20, the guys are getting used to it. But he has a
big impact in the dressing room, the amount of ideas he has is amazing."
</P>
<P>
Much has been made of the impact various strategies might have on the outcome of
Twenty20 matches but Dhoni said: "It's about how quickly the individual adapts,
about what he does on the field.
</P>
<P>
"It's not only about strategies but how you implement and how the individual you
are planning against reacts. If it was all about strategy Sachin would have been
sorted out by now and he's been playing for 20 years."
</P>
<P>
India begin their Group A campaign against Bangladesh at Trent Bridge on
Saturday.

Four killed in Yemen clashes
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Sanaa, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four Yemenis, including a policeman, were killed and 13 others wounded in two
days of clashes between police and anti-government protesters in southern Yemen,
medics and witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The deaths bring the toll of Yemenis killed since demonstrations broke out in
the south in late April to sixteen, including five security force members. The
Sanaa government has blamed the protests on southern separatists.
</P>
<P>
A policeman and a demonstrator were killed Sunday in clashes in the village of
Labouss, in the southern province of Lahij, while another demonstrator was
wounded in similar confrontations in the neighbouring village of al-Eind,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Protesters chanted slogans against the government, which is controlled by
northerners, and carried posters of Ali Nasser Mohammed, the former president of
South Yemen, which was united with North Yemen in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday, one Yemeni protestor was killed and five others wounded in
clashes when police used firearms to break up a demonstration in Dali, north of
the southern port of Aden, capital of former South Yemen.
</P>
<P>
"One protester, Tufiq al-Jaadi, died while being operated on in hospital. He was
hit by a bullet," medical sources said after the incident.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said police exchanged fire with demonstrators who carried banners with
slogans against the government.
</P>
<P>
Violence broke out again at the hospital as police tried to arrest a wounded
demonstrator, resulting in injuries to a policeman and a demonstrator, witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration in Dali was on its second day.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, one protester was killed and five others wounded as demonstrators
clashed with police in the village of Ashehir, in the southeastern region of
Hadramut, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The disturbance was triggered by demands to release locals arrested over earlier
protests against the government, they said.
</P>
<P>
Socialists who formerly ruled the south led a secession bid in 1994 that sparked
a two-month civil war before the uprising was crushed by northern forces loyal
to veteran President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
</P>
<P>
The president has warned against the risks of Yemen breaking up into "several
entities" amid trouble in the south over the past year, sparked by social
demands and charges of negligence in the impoverished state.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two civilians, one of them a child, were killed Sunday when Islamist militants
clashed briefly with Somali government forces in the capital Mogadishu,
officials and witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Insurgents had attacked police positions in the city's northern Sanaa district,
said police officer Mohamed Hashi.
</P>
<P>
"The violent elements opened fire on government positions near Sanaa," Hashi
told AFP. "There was heavy exchange of gunfire."
</P>
<P>
Local resident Abdullahi Moalim said: "Two civilians, one of them a young boy,
died in our neighbourhood after clashes erupted this afternoon."
</P>
<P>
Five people were also wounded in the fighting, said residents.
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu has been engulfed this month by fierce fighting between the two sides,
killing more than 200 people and forcing tens of thousands others to flee their
homes.
</P>
<P>
The rebel onslaught has been led by the Shebab, an extremist faction accused of
links to Al-Qaeda; and Hezb al-Islam, a more political radical group loyal to
opposition leader Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys.
</P>
<P>
The groups want to topple President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, a moderate Islamist who
came to power in January. They have confirmed that they are receiving support
from foreign fighers.
</P>
<P>
Sharif recently accused Eritrea of backing the insurgency and the African Union
has called on the United Nations to apply sanctions on Asmara.

Tennis: Safina at the double in French Open

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Top seed Dinara Safina's stroll through the French Open continued on Sunday as
she brushed aside France's Aravane Rezai 6-1, 6-0 in another centre-court
mismatch to reach the last eight.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Russian has conceded just five games in four matches as she
closes in on winning a first Grand Slam title and proving to herself and her
detractors that she is a worthy world No.1
</P>
<P>
If it was a perfect outcome for Safina, it was a poor advertisement for women's
tennis as the stage-struck Frenchwoman, who won her first tournament as a
professional in Strasbourg earlier this month, capitulated in just 53 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"Getting into the quarter-finals like this feels good," said Safina.
</P>
<P>
"I remember Australia (where she reached the final) this year and I don't know
how many hours I needed there so I am feeling good right now.
</P>
<P>
"Since I became number one I am playing better and better."
</P>
<P>
Also through to the last eight for the first time in her career was Dominika
Cibulkova of Slovakia who defeated Agnes Szavay of Hungary 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, defending champion Ana Ivanovic of Serbia was playing Victoria
Azarenka of Belarus and former world No.1 Maria Sharapova was up against Li Na
who was bidding to become the first Chinese player to reach the last eight at
Roland Garros.

Safina's quickfire win was her 18th win out of 19 matches on clay this season
and confirmed her status as favourite to win her first Grand Slam title.
</P>
<P>
Rezai, playing for just the second time in the fourth round of a Grand Slam
tournament, started as a rank outsider, but she had the first glimpse of an
opening with a break point in the third game.
</P>
<P>
Safina comfortably brushed that aside and then, helped by two double faults from
her opponent, broke serve in the following game to lead 3-1.
</P>
<P>
The world No.1 then stepped on the accelerator to also take the next three games
and the set in just 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
It was more of the same in the second set as Rezai looked helpless to counter
her much bigger and more physical opponent.
</P>
<P>
Safina bagged an early break of serve and jumped out into a 4-0 lead from which
there was no way back for the struggling Frenchwoman.
</P>
<P>
Cibulkova, at 1.61 metres one of the smallest players on the WTA circuit,
dominated the rallies against Szavay from the start of their match jumping out
into a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian, who stunned Venus Williams in the third round, steadied the ship
in the fifth game but by that time the first set was out of her reach, Cibulkova
taking it 6-2 in 38 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Cibulkova wiped out an early break against her in the second set as she won five
games in a row but failed to convert a match point in the following game and had
to wait till her next service game to wrap things up.
</P>
<P>
She will next go up against the winner of the tie between Sharapova and Li
knowing that she has already taken a step up the career ladder at Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to lose from now on in," the Slovak said.
</P>
<P>
"I was injured before Roland Garros (leg muscle) and didn't play the big
tournaments, so I was a bit afraid. But now it's amazing."

The Australian also took over the lead in the world championship standings with
his second win of the season having also triumphed in Qatar in the opening race

In a dramatic race that began in wet conditions, Stoner seized the advantage
when switching bikes after 10 laps for a change of tyres.
</P>

He was the fastest man on the track by some margin in those first few laps after
the switch and although Yamaha pair Lorenzo and Rossi were quickest at the end,
they had both lost too much time and too many places to hit back.

Israel's Netanyahu holds firm on Gaza blockade
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Jerusalem, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Sunday there would be no let-up in
Israel's much-criticised blockade of Gaza, warning that the ceasefire with the
territory's Hamas rulers remained fragile.
</P>
<P>
"We are being asked to ease the living conditions of the population and allow
goods and equipment in, but we have other priorities in the Gaza Strip," a
senior official quoted Netanyahu as telling a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to strengthen Hamas, not by allowing them to rebuild their
defences," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel tightened a crippling blockade on the Gaza Strip after Hamas, an Islamist
group pledged to the destruction of the Jewish state, violently seized power in
the territory in June 2007.
</P>
<P>
Since then Israel has allowed only essential humanitarian goods to enter the
impoverished land of 1.5 million people where the majority depend on foreign
aid.
</P>
<P>
Israel unleashed a massive 22-day offensive on Gaza on December 27 in response
to militant rocket fire, leaving more than 1,400 Palestians dead and much of the
territory in ruins.
</P>
<P>
The two declared mutual ceasefires on January 18, although both sides have
reported breaches and efforts to forge a sustainable truce have so far failed.
</P>
<P>
"The ceasefire is not complete and is very fragile," the official quoted
Netanyahu as saying. "Hamas continues to smuggle through the tunnels."
</P>
<P>
"We want to bring Gilad Shalit back home," he said, referring to an Israeli
soldier seized by Gaza militants, including Hamas, in June 2006.
</P>
<P>
"We need to find a balance between easing the conditions of the (Gaza)
population and easing on Hamas's ability to acquire more weapons."

Iraq's Kurdish region to export oil for first time
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
DOHUK, Iraq, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraq's self-ruled Kurdish region will begin exporting crude oil for the first
time on Monday, piping up to 90,000 bpd to its neighbours, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Companies chosen by the regional government will pump oil from two Kurdish
fields via an Iraqi pipeline to Turkey with the consent of Baghdad in a step
that could pave the way to ending bitter domestic feuds over Iraq's oil wealth.
</P>
<P>
Initial exports will be around 40,000 barrels per day from the Taq Taq field in
the province of Arbil and another 50,000 bpd from the Tawke field in Dohuk,
company officials told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"Piping of the oil will start Monday morning from the Taq Taq field, pumping it
from seven wells," said Mohammed Okotan, director of the Taq Taq project for
Turkey's Genel Enerji, which is partnered with Calgary-based Addax Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to reach 60,000 barrels a day by the end of this year," said
Okotan, adding that the project aims to double exports in two years.
</P>
<P>
"The quality of the crude is excellent," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the Tawke field, northwest of Taq Taq, Norwegian oil firm DNO will also start
pumping oil for export on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We'll start with 50,000 bpd and we'll see how this operation goes and if we can
increase it," said DNO director of operations Jon Sargent.
</P>
<P>
Disagreements over oil rights, especially between Baghdad and the Kurdish
government, have held up exploitation of much of Iraq's massive reserves as well
as long-delayed hydrocarbons legislation.
</P>
<P>
Terms of the Taq Taq deal are for Baghdad to receive 88 percent of revenues. of
which the Kurd region will get back 17 percent. Genel Enerji and Addax will
share 12 percent, Okotan told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Executives from DNO refused to provide revenue sharing figures, although one DNO
official confided that the terms are quite similar to those in the Tawke field.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is in dire need of revenue to rebuild its shattered economy, especially
after oil prices fell from a peak of 147 dollars a barrel last July to a current
level just above 60 dollars, putting huge pressure on Iraq's budget.
</P>
<P>
The nation derives more than 90 percent of its revenues from the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
Iraq hopes to be able to pump six million barrels per day, up from its current
stated output of around 2.2 million, within the next four to five years as new
projects come online.
</P>
<P>
The conflict-ravaged country has the world's third largest proven reserves of
oil, with more than 115 billion barrels, behind only Saudi Arabia and Iran.

Hundreds of insurgents killed in Afghan operations: govt

<DATELINE>
KABUL, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A series of Afghan army operations to clean up insurgent hotspots ahead of
August elections has resulted in 248 militants being killed along with 17
soldiers, the defence ministry said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The operations were rolled out in five eastern and southern provinces 10 days
ago and are continuing, ministry spokesman General Mohammad Zahir Azimi told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"During these operations, 248 enemy were killed and dozens of others have been
wounded," Azimi said.
</P>
<P>
"In the same period, 17 brave service members have been martyred and 57 have
been wounded, and four are missing," he said.
</P>
<P>
The operations were in the Helmand, Uruzgan, Ghazni, Farah and Paktika
provinces, all areas which have a heavy Taliban influence.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to use the available capacities of the national forces and NATO
and coalition forces, and the troops that will be deployed in the future, to
create an atmosphere where our people could vote freely," Azimi said.
</P>
<P>
The multinational NATO-led force has secured thousands of extra soldiers for the
August 20 polling day.
</P>
<P>
The force already has nearly 60,000 troops in Afghanistan to help the government
fight a Taliban insurgency and build its own capacity.
</P>
<P>
The elections, the second-ever presidential vote in Afghanistan, are a key test
of international efforts to install democracy in a land beset by war, coups and
assassinations.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have called for a boycott of the polls and there are fears that the
insurgents will step up attacks to disrupt polls or keep voters at home.
</P>
<P>
A candidate for the provincial council elections, which will be held at the same
time as the presidential election, was killed last week in a bomb attack.

Tennis: I was almost signed off by autograph hunter, admits Gonzalez
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Big-hitting Chilean Fernando Gonzalez revealed on Sunday how a freak injury
signing autographs almost shattered his French Open dreams.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Chilean, who outgunned Romania's Victor Hanescu 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 to
reach the Roland Garros quarter-finals for the third time, injured his ankle
while signing photos and tennis balls for fans at the Rome Masters in April.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he spent a month on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
"I was signing autographs and someone called me from the other side of the court
and when I ran over to them, I twisted my ankle," said Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
"I think I only managed to sign two and then I had to go back to the locker room
because my ankle was so painful."
</P>
<P>
The freak accident meant Gonzalez had to skip the rest of the claycourt season
to recover in time for the French Open.
</P>
<P>
But despite the Rome scare, he believes he is now playing some of the best
tennis of his 10-year career.
</P>
<P>
"I think on average I am playing my best," said Gonzalez who made the semi-
finals in Rome where he was defeated by Rafael Nadal before being completely
finished off by his injury.
</P>
<P>
"I have played at a good level almost in every match. I enjoy going onto the
courts and into practice although as I am getting older I tend to practice less
but with more intensity."
</P>
<P>
The 12th seeded Gonzalez will now tackle either British third seed Andy Murray
or Marin Cilic, the 13th seeded Croatian, for a place in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez simply overpowered 30th seed Hanescu.
</P>
<P>
The result was never in doubt from the time the Chilean, who lost to Juan Carlos
Ferrero in the 2003 quarter-finals and Roger Federer at the same stage last
year, broke twice in the first four games of the first set to take a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
With his trademark, booming forehand forcing the beanpole Romanian to scamper
haplessly from side to side, the Chilean wrapped up the opening set in just 25
minutes.
</P>
<P>
A break in the ninth game was enough to decide the second set, as the rallies
remained fierce and short, while another break of the dispirited and one-
dimensional Hanescu in the first game of the third set Gonzalez on his way.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, whose best Grand Slam performance remains his runner-up spot to
Federer at the 2007 Australian Open, broke through again in the seventh game to
stretch to 5-2.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 Roland Garros junior champion then wrapped up the tie with his 50th
winner to finish off Hanescu after only 87 minutes.

<P>
Germany have tentatively organised friendly internationals with Chile and Egypt
on November 14 and 18, general manager Oliver Bierhoff told the SID sports
agency on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The matches are dependent on Germany landing first place in their World Cup
qualifying Group 4, Bierhoff explained.
</P>
<P>
Currently, they lead Russia by four points with five wins and a draw in six
matches, but the latter have a game in hand, while Finland are well adrift in
third place five points further back.
</P>
<P>
Three-time winners Germany are already well advanced with preparations for the
finals and intend to have three friendlies in Africa before heading for the
finals in South Africa, assuming they qualify.
</P>
<P>
The Germans are tipped to set up their headquarters in Gauteng province, which
includes Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is talking of Cape Town and its region but we would have optimum
facilities in Gauteng - winter is drier there, altitude is 1600 metres and
that's important as most matches will be played at that altitude," said
Bierhoff.

Israel softens controversial Naqba bill
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JERUSALEM, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet on Sunday softened a much-criticized bill on the Naqba, what
many Palestinians lament as the  "catastrophe" of the 1948 creation of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The revised draft law now prohibits any government funds from being used for
events marking the Naqba, instead of banning commemorations altogether, a
government official said.
</P>
<P>
"The original bill marked a serious infringement on the freedom of expression,
which we deemed excessive," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The changes followed a legal review of the bill approved by the cabinet last
week, which would have prohibited any events marking Naqba and provided for
penalties of up to three years in prison.
</P>
<P>
In the week following the bill's submission by Foreign Minister Avigdor
Lieberman's ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party, the draft was attacked by
both Arab MPs and rights groups.
</P>
<P>
The bill must still pass three votes by parliament to become law.
</P>
<P>
A government committee also on Sunday scrapped another Yisrael Beitenu draft
law, which would have required Israelis to take an oath of loyalty and which
mainly targeted Israel's Arab minority.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Arabs and the extent of their loyalty to the Jewish state was the top
campaign theme of the secular Yisrael Beitenu, which came in third in the
February election, winning 15 of parliament's 120 seats.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Arab community comprises around 1.2 million people, out of a total
population of about seven million.

Taiwan's opposition pushes for China trade referendum
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
taipei, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's pro-independence opposition on Sunday renewed its pledge to hold a
referendum aimed at stopping the Beijing-friendly administration from signing a
comprehensive trade pact with China.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said it hopes to collect at least 80,000
signatures before the end of August in the first part of a two-step process
required by law for the campaign, announced last month, to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
Once it reaches its target figure, the party will then have to enlist the
endorsements of up to one million supporters before a referendum can take place.
</P>
<P>
"Concerns are mounting about signing an ECFA (Economic Cooperation Framework
Agreement) with China as it is not a pure trade agreement. Rather it has
something to do with sovereignty," DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said.
</P>
<P>
"People here are entitled to decide if Taiwan people, through a referendum,
approve such an agreement with China," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ma Ying-jeou administration is targeting the pact -- similar in scope to a
free trade agreement -- with Beijing to boost the flow of goods and personnel
across the Strait and to help the island tackle recession.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Hu Jintao told visiting Wu Poh-hsiung, chairman of the
Kuomintang, in Beijing last week that talks on the ECFA were likely to start in
the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Hu said the mainland would like to see an economic agreement that will benefit
economic development on both sides and improve people's welfare,  according to
the Xinhua news agency.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's Economic Minister Yiin Chii-ming had defended the trade pact, claiming
that the island's economy could rise by 1.4 percentage points by forging an
economic pact with China.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the petrochemical sector, machinery and auto components makers
are expected to benefit from closer cross-strait ties, Yiin said.
</P>
<P>
But the DPP has strongly opposed the potential pact, which it claims would
demote Taipei to the status of local government in any rapprochement talks.
</P>
<P>
China still regards Taiwan as part of its territory awaiting reunification by
force if necessary, although the two sides have been governed separately since
the end of a civil war in 1949.

Former Germany star Lothar Matthaus, currently in charge at Israel's Maccabi

</P>
<P>
"There is much to do at Dusseldorf, the club should be in the top flight and
that has to be the goal," Matthaus, 48, told Bild newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Dusseldorf have a long history and were champions in 1933 while they have also
won the German Cup twice - but they have just been promoted to the second
division after a decade in the third.
</P>
<P>
Businessman Daniel Jammer, who already owns Maccabi Netanya and is close to
Matthaus, is reputedly interested in investing in the outfit and told Bild he
saw Matthaus in the role of sporting director.
</P>
<P>
Matthaus described the possibility as potentially "a very interesting mission."
</P>
<P>
To date, Matthaus, who won a host of honours with Bayern Munich and led Germany
to the 1990 World Cup, has coached in several countries but has yet really to

brushing aside Agnes Szavay of Hungary 6-2, 6-4 to reach the quarter-finals of
the French Open.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the 20-year-old from Bratislava has made it through to
the last eight of a Grand Slam event at her eighth attempt.
</P>
<P>
"It was difficult because we were both nervous at the beginning and it was a
case of not making mistakes," she said.
</P>
<P>
"But I prepared well for this game and knew how she would play."
</P>
<P>
One of the smallest players on the WTA circuit at just 1.61 metres, Cibulkova
had failed to take a set of Szavay in their three previous encounters, but she
was quickly out of the blocks this time breaking serve twice for a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Szavay, who stunned Venus Williams in the third round, steadied the ship in the
fifth game but by that time the first set was out of her reach, Cibulkova taking
it 6-2 in 38 minutes.
</P>
<P>
It was a different story at the start of the second half with Cibulkova
tightening up and dropping serve to go 0-2 down, but she snatched one back in
the next to level at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
The 20th seed then broke again in the fifth game keeping up a steady stream of
baseline groundstrokes and allowing Szavay to make the errors as she sought a
solution to her opponent's dominance of the rallies.
</P>
<P>
There looked to be no way back for the demoralised Hungarian as Cibulkova got to
match point on her own serve at 5-2 ahead.
</P>
<P>
But a wild forehand let that slip away and she followed up with a double fault
at break point to hand her opponent an unlikely lifeline.
</P>
<P>
Szavay staved off another match point on her own serve by coming into the net
more often, but Cibulkova this time held steady on her own service game to set
up a quarter-final tie against either former world No. 1 Maria Sharapova of
Russia or Li Na of China.
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to lose from now on in," the Slovak said.
</P>
<P>
"I was injured before Roland Garros (leg muscle) and didn't play the big
tournaments, so I was a bit afraid. But now it's amazing."

<P>
Top seed Dinara Safina eased into the French Open quarter-finals on Sunday
defeating Aravane Rezai of France 6-1, 6-0 in a 53-minute centre-court mismatch.
</P>
<P>
It was the Russian's 18th win out of 19 matches on clay this season and
confirmed her status as favourite to win her first Grand Slam title.
</P>
<P>
Rezai, playing for just the second time in the fourth round of a Grand Slam
tournament, started as a rank outsider, but she had the first glimpse of an
opening with a break point in the third game.
</P>
<P>
Safina though comfortably brushed that aside and then, helped by two double
faults from her opponent, broke serve in the following game to lead 3-1.
</P>
<P>
Safina, whose four games lost in her first three matches are the third least in
all Grand Slams, then stepped on the accelerator to also take the next three
games and the set in just 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
It was more of the same in the second set as Rezai seemed to be stage-struck on
the Philippe Chatrier centre court against her much bigger and more physical
opponent.
</P>
<P>
Safina bagged an early break of serve and jumped out into a 4-0 lead from which
there was no way back for the struggling Frenchwoman.

Troops hunt Taliban as Pakistan says victory near
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PESHAWAR, Pakistan, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pakistan's defence secretary said Sunday that a month-long offensive to crush
Taliban fighters in the northwest could end within days, as fierce fighting
spilled into a nearby tribal area.
</P>
<P>
Swat valley's main town Mingora is back in government hands, the military
announced late Saturday, and security officials said they were now pursuing the
top leadership of the hardline Taliban movement into the nearby mountains.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Defence Syed Athar Ali told a security forum in Singapore that
three targeted northwest districts were almost clear of Taliban rebels.
</P>
<P>
"Operations in Swat, Buner and adjoining areas have almost met complete
success," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Only five to ten percent of the job is remaining and hopefully within the next
two to three days these pockets of resistance will be cleared."
</P>
<P>
The army remains locked in battle in some areas, but the fall of Mingora was a
critical milestone in an offensive launched after the Taliban thrust to within
100 kilometres (60 miles) of Islamabad in April.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's military also reported that 25 militants and seven soldiers were
killed in clashes in South Waziristan near the Afghan border, a bolt-hole for
Taliban and Al-Qaeda-linked militants south of the current army bombardment.
</P>
<P>
"Miscreants attacked a security forces checkpost last night (Saturday) in
Spinkai Raghzai, South Waziristan agency. The attack was repulsed successfully,
inflicting heavy casualties on militants," it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen militants and three soldiers died in the clash in Spinkai Raghzai, while
elsewhere in the semi-autonomous tribal area 10 insurgents and four troops
including a lieutenant died when rebels attacked a military convoy.
</P>
<P>
Civilians have started fleeing the area fearing a fresh military onslaught, but
the army has denied an imminent assault on Waziristan, where militants branded
by Washington as the greatest terror threat to the West are holed up.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which is firmly backing the current military drive, had
warned that the rebels threaten Pakistan's very existence.
</P>
<P>
Officials have said that lower-ranking Taliban leaders had been killed but it
was harder to get to the top leaders, who had a network of hardcore militants
around them and had slipped into the rugged mountain terrain.
</P>
<P>
"They will be eliminated wherever we find them," said one military official, who
did not wish to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media, adding:
"We believe that they are somewhere in the mountains."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has slapped a 600,000-dollar price on the head of firebrand Swat
Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah for masterminding the nearly two-year
uprising in the valley to enforce sharia law.
</P>
<P>
Fazlullah led thousands of supporters in a campaign that has beheaded opponents,
burned schools and fought government troops since November 2007.
</P>
<P>
The government has also offered rewards for 21 rebel chiefs -- wanted dead or
alive -- from Swat. The military claims to have killed 1,244 militants since the
offensive began, although the numbers are impossible to verify.
</P>
<P>
As the government ups its campaign to stamp out the militants, fears are growing
of a wave of revenge attacks.
</P>
<P>
The northwestern capital Peshawar and the eastern cultural centre of Lahore have
both been rocked by deadly explosions in the last five days, killing a total of
39 people and wounding hundreds more.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Pakistan Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud -- who has a five-
million-dollar bounty on his head posted by the United States -- has claimed
Wednesday's suicide bombing on a police building in Lahore.
</P>
<P>
Hakimullah Mehsud also warned of more "massive attacks" to avenge the Swat
military operation and in protest at Islamabad's ties with Washington.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2.4 million people have fled the current offensive, and the military
relaxed a curfew Sunday in most parts of the northwest including Mingora to
allow people trapped on the roads to return home or leave the region.
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday, Taliban militants attacked a school in Hangu town south of
Peshawar, killing one administrator and kidnapping three other people, local
policeman Shoukat Hussain said.
</P>
<P>
In North Waziristan, meanwhile, a former government doctor and an Afghan
national were killed by suspected militants, officials said.

Palestinian tensions mount after deadly shoot-out
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NABLUS, West Bank, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six people were killed in a West Bank shoot-out on Sunday when an attempt to
arrest a senior Hamas commander went awry, deepening the rift between the two
main Palestinian factions.
</P>
<P>
The Islamist Hamas movement ruling the Gaza Strip warned that the rival Fatah
group loyal to president Mahmud Abbas had crossed a "red line" over the killing
of one of its top fighters in the arrest operation.
</P>
<P>
The gunfight erupted when Palestinian police dominated by Fatah tried to arrest
Mohammed al-Samman, the commander of Hamas's armed wing in the northern West
Bank who was also on Israel's wanted list.
</P>
<P>
Samman barricaded himself in a house in the town of Qalqiliya in the north of
the Israeli-occupied territory together with Mohammed Yassin, another Hamas
militant, police and Hamas said.
</P>
<P>
The ensuing shoot-out killed both Hamas men, three Palestinian policemen and a
civilian. A curfew was imposed on the town near the border with Israel following
the incident, police said.
</P>
<P>
Hamas branded the incident a "red line" and said it laid "complete
responsibility of this ugly crime on Abbas and his security forces."
</P>
<P>
Describing Abbas and his forces as agents of arch-enemy Israel, Hamas said in a
statement that it would respond "with acts," without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
"There is no difference between the occupation who shoots and the people who
carry out their missions for them," a spokesman for Hamas's armed wing said at a
press conference in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The deep-seated rivalries between Hamas and Fatah boiled over in June 2007 when
the Islamists violently seized control of Gaza, causing a split in Palestinian
ranks that has become a key stumbling block in efforts to reach Middle East
peace.
</P>
<P>
Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhum said there was no chance of further reconciliation
talks with Fatah after the "escalation by security services of Abu Mazen and
Fatah against Hamas and its leaders in the West Bank."
</P>
<P>
"Fatah should choose -- dialogue with us or doing the dirty work of the Zionist
enemy," Barhum said as Hamas decried the killing over mosque loudspeakers in
Gaza City.
</P>
<P>
A senior official from the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority dismissed the Hamas
accusations as "lies."
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian Authority has one duty -- to impose security and the law and we
will not allow what happened in Gaza to happen here in the West Bank under any
circumstances," he said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Palestinian security forces, Adnan Damiri, defended the arrest
operation.
</P>
<P>
"We in the Palestinian security branches are not a political force. We are
security. We will not allow any Palestinian party to have guns and threaten
civilians."
</P>
<P>
Damiri also said that during the arrest, police discovered Hamas leaflets
containing "incitement against the Palestinian Authority and against the
Palestinian security branches."
</P>
<P>
"We consider what happened today as very dangerous," he said. "It was an attempt
to destroy any hope of resuming the (reconciliation) dialogue."
</P>
<P>
Abbas's power based has been limited to the occupied West Bank since Hamas
booted his Fatah party out of the Gaza Strip, which remains under a crippling
Israeli blockade.
</P>
<P>
The two factions held five rounds of talks under Egyptian mediation in an
attempt to reconcile but to no avail and the two sides have frequently accused
their rivals of campaigns of persecution.
</P>
<P>
Rights group Amnesty International has lambasted both Hamas and Fatah for
arbitrary detentions, torture and suppression of freedom of speech in their
respective areas of control.
</P>
<P>
The Western-backed Abbas swore in a new Palestinian cabinet that includes
members of Fatah but not Hamas on May 20, further widening the sectarian rift.

Berlusconi to meet Obama in June

<TEXT>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said Sunday he will meet next month in
Washington with US President Barack Obama ahead of July's Group of Eight summit
in Italy.
</P>
<P>
"I will meet with Obama on June 15 to discuss new global financial and economic
regulations," Berlusconi said on Rai television.
</P>
<P>
The meeting "will be one of the most important of the past few years," the
conservative premier added.
</P>
<P>
Italy, which currently heads the G8 rich nations club, will host the summit on
July 8-10 in L'Aquila, the town that was devastated by an earthquake in April
which claimed some 299 lives.
</P>
<P>
Overshadowed by the global economic crisis, Berlusconi predicted that the next
G8 summit "will be intense".
</P>
<P>
The first day of a G8 summit -- grouping Italy and the US along with Britain,
Canada, France, Germany, Japan and Russia -- is traditionally reserved for
meetings between the leaders of the member countries.
</P>
<P>
On the second day, the eight are usually joined by representatives of the G14
emerging countries, followed on the last day by African nations and the African
Union.

Thousands march in Hong Kong to mark Tiananmen crackdown
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong Kong, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of protesters marched through Hong Kong on Sunday to commemorate the
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing 20 years ago, including one
of the leaders from Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
Organisers said around 5,000 people rallied through the streets of the city to
mark the anniversary of the military crackdown, which left hundreds, possibly
thousands dead following weeks of protests in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Among the marchers was Xiong Yan, a leading student activist during the 1989
demonstrations who now lives in exile in the United States.
</P>
<P>
He was surprisingly allowed into Hong Kong on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Cheuk-yan, a pro-democracy legislator in Hong Kong and one of the organisers
of the annual march, said it was crucial that the city continued to mark the
events of 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"We are the only place on Chinese soil that can commemorate June 4," he told
AFP.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has become the conscience of China to remember... the crime of the
Tiananmen Square massacre and push the regime (in Beijing) to admit their
mistakes."
</P>
<P>
The attendance at the march was sharply up on last year's figures. An annual
candlelit vigil on Thursday is expected to attract tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
Xiong, who was put on a list of the authorities' 21 "most-wanted" student
protesters after the occupation of Tiananmen was broken up, spent two years in
jail before being smuggled to the US via Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
His entry was unexpected because of China's sensitive attitude to any criticism
of the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
Other 1989 campaigners have been refused entry to Hong Kong in the past,
although it has a separate legal and immigration system from the mainland,
including the right to protest.
</P>
<P>
"I was very surprised as I have tried many, many times to come," said Xiong, who
arrived Saturday night, the first time he had set foot on Chinese soil in 17
years.
</P>
<P>
"I hope in the future I can not only go to Hong Kong, but also to Beijing," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The marchers gathered in the city's Victoria Park, waving banners with slogans
such as "Pass the torch on, relay the message of democracy to those who come
after us" and "Speak the truth, never forget."
</P>
<P>
The rally included a small group of mainland Chinese students, who wore T-shirts
citing former Communist leader Mao Zedong: "Whoever suppresses student movements
is going to have a bad ending."
</P>
<P>
"I am very excited to see so many people, as this is forbidden on the mainland,"
said one of the students, 20, who did not want to be named.
</P>
<P>
"(It shows) there is hope," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Danish sculptor who flew to Hong Kong to protest the bloody
crackdown was refused entry.
</P>
<P>
Jens Galschiot, whose sculpture commemorating those who died in the 1989
military crackdown, "Pillar of Shame," is displayed at Hong Kong University, was
stopped by officials Saturday and sent back to Zurich, an immigration spokesman
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Albert Ho, chairman of the Democratic Party and a lawyer, said the Dane was
detained for five hours before being put on a flight to Zurich late Saturday. Ho
said he was looking at possible legal action over the decision.
</P>
<P>
Many of Hong Kong's leading democrats joined the march, including veteran
campaigner Martin Lee, who on Saturday revealed he had been the target of an
assassination plot.
</P>
<P>
Two men have been charged in relation to the plot which was foiled last year,
but only revealed on Saturday. The pair will appear in a Hong Kong court on June
16.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who has been at the forefront of the campaign to overturn Beijing's
official condemnation of the Tiananmen protesters, said he was sure there was no
involvement of the Communist Party.

Israeli committee rejects oath of loyalty bill

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Israeli government committee on Sunday rejected a bill tabled by the ultra-
nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party that would have required Israelis to take an
oath of loyalty, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The legislation committee scrapped the bill proposed by Foreign Minister Avigdor
Lieberman's party by a vote of eight to three, an official told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Although MPs could pursue the measure and reintroduce the bill on their own, the
move effectively strips the proposal of government approval and significantly
lowers the chances it would pass into law.
</P>
<P>
The pledge of allegiance was a key element in Yisrael Beitenu's campaigning for
the February general election, in which it came in third, winning 15 of the 120
seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The bill by the secular nationalist party was aimed mostly at Arab citizens --
some 20 percent of Israel's population -- and also at the ultra-Orthodox
community. Neither group does the military service mandatory for most Israelis.

Armenia opposition pins hopes on Yerevan poll
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
YEREVAN, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of the Armenian capital voted in a municipal election Sunday in which
the main opposition movement is seeking to gain an important foothold on power
after losing political ground last year.
</P>
<P>
The Armenian National Congress is hoping it can win enough seats on the 65-seat
Yerevan city council for its leader -- former president Levon Ter-Petrosian --
to be elected mayor.
</P>
<P>
The vote has raised fears of a repeat of the violence after last year's
presidential elections that saw 10 people killed in clashes between riot police
and opposition supporters.
</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrosian and his backers accused the authorities of rigging the vote to
guarantee a win for President Serzh Sarkisian, who defeated Ter-Petrosian.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say it is likely the opposition will hold protests if it loses again,
risking another confrontation.
</P>
<P>
"The municipal elections are the first stage of ridding the country of this
criminal regime," said 29-year-old voter Astkhik Petrosian. "I voted for the
opposition. Once they have taken power in the city we will be able to have new
early presidential elections."
</P>
<P>
Voting began at 8:00 am (0400 GMT) and by three hours later voter turnout had
reached 11.72 percent, the Central Election Commission said.
</P>
<P>
The city council will chose the mayor under constitutional amendments adopted in
2005. Armenia's president previously made the appointment for the four-year
term.
</P>
<P>
If any party wins 40 percent of the seats, its candidate becomes the city mayor,
otherwise the mayor is to be elected by the city council.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results are to be announced within 24 hours after the vote and the
final results during the next seven days.
</P>
<P>
Yerevan's current mayor, Gagik Beglarian, is topping the ruling Republican
party's list in the municipal vote and opinion polls showed him leading.
</P>
<P>
"Beglarian has done a lot as mayor. It is easy to see that the city has become
more beautiful and orderly, that the city has changed for the better. So I voted
for the Republican party," said 43-year-old voter Sarkis.
</P>
<P>
Beglarian told journalists Sunday the vote was proceeding smoothly.
</P>
<P>
"No violations have been observed. The situation is quiet and we can already
observe heavy voter activity," he said.
</P>
<P>
The international community will be watching the vote to see if Armenia is
keeping its commitments on democratic reforms. The observers' delegation
includes the Council of Europe and European Union representatives.

<TEXT>
<P>
At least 25 suspected militants and seven Pakistani troops were killed Sunday in
fierce clashes in a northwest tribal area and known Taliban bolt-hole near the
Afghan border, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Battles erupted overnight in South Waziristan when militants attacked an army
checkpoint and security targets in the town of Spinkai Raghzai and other
villages in the district, the military said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Miscreants attacked a security forces checkpost last night (Saturday) in
Spinkai Raghzai, South Waziristan agency. The attack was repulsed successfully,
inflicting heavy casualties on militants," it said.
</P>
<P>
Troops killed 15 insurgents in that clash while three soldiers died, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident in South Waziristan, 10 militants were killed when
Pakistani forces returned fire on rebels who shot at a military convoy, it said.
Four soldiers including a lieutenant were killed in the clash.
</P>
<P>
Security officials in the area gave higher tolls of the militant dead from both
incidents.
</P>
<P>
"According to fresh reports we received from the site, more than 45 militants
died," Syed Ahmad, a police official in the tribal area, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Khan Badshah, another local official, confirmed that death toll and said the
rebels had taken most of the bodies away for funeral rites.
</P>
<P>
The military death tolls are impossible to confirm independently.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's lawless tribal areas have been beset by violence since Afghanistan's
Taliban regime was toppled by the 2001 US-led invasion, prompting hundreds of
Taliban and Al-Qaeda-linked fighters to flood the region.
</P>
<P>
Security forces are currently locked in a fierce offensive against Taliban
militants in three other northwest districts, and there have been reports --
which the army denies -- that the assault may soon expand to Waziristan.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2.4 million people have fled the month-long army offensive in Lower Dir,
Buner and Swat districts, and thousands of civilians have already started
leaving Waziristan fearful of a fresh campaign, provincial officials have said.

The month-long drills involving about 1,100 troops from 10 NATO countries and
six of the alliance's partner countries were to end on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which fought a brief war with Georgia in August over the rebel South
Ossetia region, denounced the exercises as "provocative" and announced plans to
step up its own military training exercises near the Georgian border next month.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that although they were planned before last year's war, the
exercises have boosted Georgia's hopes of building closer ties with the Western
military alliance.
</P>
<P>
"They prove that the West, and NATO in particular, has not lost interest in
Georgia after the August war," political analyst Soso Tsintsadze told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"The holding of these exercises in Georgia despite the strongest objections from
Moscow is a cold shower for the Kremlin," he said.
</P>
<P>
The manoeuvres were aimed at improving the way nations operate together in
crisis situations under a UN mandate.
</P>
<P>
The exercises had two components, NATO headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
The first -- "Cooperative Longbow" -- was a "command post" exercise done almost
exclusively on computers. The second -- "Cooperative Lancer" -- which started on
May 18 and ends Monday, is a field exercise involving around 400 troops and is
designed to provide training on peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
Russian leaders denounced the drills, with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin calling
them "a step backwards" in resetting Russia-US relations.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials also said the NATO exercises would lead to "adjustments" in
strategic and tactical manoeuvres entitled "Caucasus 2009" that are scheduled to
take place in the region in June.
</P>
<P>
The exercises were held amid political uncertainty in Georgia as opposition
supporters have protested for weeks to demand President Mikheil Saakashvili's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
Opponents accuse Saakashvili of mishandling the war with Russia and of becoming
increasingly autocratic since taking power after the peaceful Rose Revolution in
2003.
</P>
<P>
Minor clashes have broken out between police and protesters, raising fears of
wider unrest.
</P>
<P>
The day before the exercises began, Georgia also said it had peacefully put down
a mutiny at a military base outside Tbilisi aimed at disrupting the drills.
Georgia initially accused Russia of backing an armed coup -- an accusation
Moscow described as "insane."

Sudan buries ex-president who imposed Islamic rule
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
KHARTOUM, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sudan on Sunday buried former president Gaafar al-Nimeiry, the man who imposed
Islamic rule on Africa's largest nation, at a funeral attended by ordinary
Sudanese, politicians and military officials.
</P>
<P>
President Omar al-Beshir led the funeral procession as Nimeiry's body, wrapped
in a Sudanese flag, was carried by military officials to his burial site in
Omdurman, Khartoum's twin city.
</P>
<P>
"There is no God but Allah," chanted about 3,000 men dressed in traditional
white robes, as well military officers, policemen and a handful of politicians
gathered at a stadium in Omdurman.
</P>
<P>
Nimeiry, who came to power in a coup in 1969 with the support of communist and
socialist leaders, died in a military hospital on Saturday at the age of 79
after a long illness.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of his relatives and supporters gathered outside his home in Omdurman's
Wad Nabawi neighbourhood on Saturday to recite prayers after news of his death.
</P>
<P>
In 1972, he oversaw the end of a civil war that had plagued the country since
1955, pitting the north against the mainly Christian and animist south but an
economic crisis in the late 70s and early 80s saw his grip on power weaken.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, bowing to pressure from the Islamists, he introduced Islamic sharia law
to Africa's largest nation but two years later, in 1985, he was ousted in
another coup.
</P>
<P>
Nimeiry was also a career officer who received military training in an academy
in the United States in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Beshir said in a statement that Nimeiry would be remembered as the man who
brought Islamic law to Sudan, and which is still imposed in the north of the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Nimeiry was a sincere man, a leader with a heart," said Abel Alier, who served
as vice president under Nimeiry between 1971-1981. "He achieved many good things
but he also did things he should not have done."
</P>
<P>
"He signed peace with the south in 1972. Many people have forgotten that but (at
the time) it was the good thing to do," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nimeiry's ouster from power in 1985 by General Sawar al-Dahab paved the way for
democratic elections in Sudan which saw the head of the powerful Umma Party,
Sadeq al-Mahdi, elected to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
But Mahdi was overthrown by Beshir in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Nimeiry lived 14 years in exile in Egypt after his ouster, returning to Sudan in
1999.

Myanmar's Suu Kyi trades barbs with junta over trial
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
YANGON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Myanmar's military junta accused Aung San Suu Kyi Sunday of covering up a visit
to her home by a US man which led to her trial, as the pro-democracy icon hit
back against the "bullying" generals.
</P>
<P>
The regime said the Nobel laureate was not above the law and issued its sternest
warning yet against foreign interference in the case, under which she faces up
to five years' jail for breaching her house arrest.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi has proclaimed her innocence at the closed prison trial,
insisting that she only offered "temporary shelter" to American John Yettaw
after he swam to her lakeside house, and has branded the proceedings as biased.
</P>
<P>
"It is no doubt that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has committed a cover-up of the truth
by her failure to report an illegal immigrant to the authorities concerned,"
Major General Aye Myint, Myanmar's deputy defence minister, told a security
forum in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"Thus there was no option but to open legal proceedings in accordance with the
law," Aye Myint said. "She permitted him to stay.... She communicated, provided
him food and shelter."
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi has spent 13 of the last 19 years in detention, mostly at her
crumbling lakeside mansion. She was moved to Yangon's notorious Insein prison
and charged on May 14.
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old opposition leader met with her lawyers at the jail on Saturday
ahead of final arguments in the case, which are due to be heard on Friday. A
guilty verdict is widely expected.
</P>
<P>
Her party said Sunday that she was upset that Myanmar authorities had entered
her residential compound without permission to stage a reconstruction of
Yettaw's visit for the purposes of the trial.
</P>
<P>
"Aung San Suu Kyi said she is not completely satisfied as Mr Yettaw and the
authorities went into her compound last week for a demonstration (of how he got
into the property)," party spokesman Nyan Win told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"It was not in accordance with the law. She said it was unjust bullying," added
Nyan Win, who is also part of her legal team.
</P>
<P>
Yettaw, a 53-year-old Mormon and former US military veteran, was arrested on May
6 after swimming to Aung San Suu Kyi's house using a pair of homemade flippers
and spending two nights there.
</P>
<P>
He has told the court that he had had a vision that Aung San Suu Kyi would be
assassinated by "terrorists" and was told by God to warn both the opposition
leader and the Myanmar government.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi said in a statement to the court this week that she could not
be held responsible as the junta had failed to boost security despite her having
reported that Yettaw made a previous visit to the house in November 2008.
</P>
<P>
However Nyan Win quoted the democracy campaigner as saying that she "has no
grudge to Mr Yettaw and his family."
</P>
<P>
International critics accuse Myanmar's military regime of trumping up the
charges in a bid to keep her locked up ahead of elections in 2010, as the latest
six-year period of her house arrest expired on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But in his speech in Singapore, Myanmar's Aye Myint said the case against Aung
San Suu Kyi was an internal matter.
</P>
<P>
"Countries should refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of Myanmar
that will affect peace and security of the region," said Aye Myint.
</P>
<P>
"It is the universal legal principle that no one is above the law," he said
</P>
<P>
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates, speaking at the same forum on Saturday,
pressed Myanmar to free Aung San Suu Kyi and said there needed to be "real
change in Burma". Burma is Myanmar's former name.
</P>
<P>
Ann Taylor, Britain's minister for international defence and security, made a
similar call on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar last week hit back at rare criticism from the normally placid fellow
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) over the treatment
of the democracy campaigner.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, whose country holds the rotating
chairmanship of the 10-member bloc, said ASEAN leaders would discuss Myanmar at
a summit in South Korea on June 1-2.

Motorcycling: Pasini wins thrilling 250cc Italian Grand Prix

Rome, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Italian Mattia Pasini won the 250cc Italian Grand Prix after a thrilling last
lap battle with countryman Marco Simoncelli here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Pasini bagan the last lap in front but had lost the lead by the first bend to
the reigning champion and thereafter the lead changed at least a half dozen
times before Aprilia rider Pasini held on through the last few bends to win his
first race of the season.
</P>
<P>
In pouring rain Simoncelli and championship leader Alvaro Bautista started off
battling for the lead, with the Spaniard going in front on the ninth lap when
the Italian ran wide.
</P>
<P>
However, on the 10th lap the pair touched when battling for the lead and both
ran off into the gravel.
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, they both managed to stay upright and rejoined the track but Pasini
had come through and led by 5sec to Simoncelli with Bautista a further 5sec
back.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard was clearly the fastest rider on the wet track and quickly caught
Simoncelli, who was closing in more steadily on his compatriot.
</P>
<P>
But three laps out a mistake from Bautista saw him lose a second and a half and
leave the two Italians to fight for the victory.
</P>
<P>
And after the final lap drama Pasini took the chequered flag in 45min 38.391sec
with Simoncelli just 0.117sec behind.

Boyle looks to the future despite British talent show defeat
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unlikely Scottish singing sensation Susan Boyle was plotting her future Sunday
after her shock defeat in the "Britain's Got Talent" television show which made
her a worldwide star thanks to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Boyle, a frumpy, 48-year-old church volunteer, will reportedly earn up to eight
million pounds (nine million euros, 13 million dollars) in the next year from a
record deal, book about her life and even a film.
</P>
<P>
She is set to start rehearsing for an album of showtunes this week and will fly
to Prague next month for recording sessions with the Czech National Symphony
Orchestra, British media said.
</P>
<P>
Boyle's career looks likely to reach new heights even though she lost to the
multi-ethnic street dancers Diversity in a public vote of one million viewers
after the talent show final late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Despite winning praise from the audience and the judges in her last performance
on live television, Boyle was forced into second place, saying the "best people
won" and wishing the dance troupe winners "all the best".
</P>
<P>
Boyle enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame over the past two months after video
footage of her audition piece for the show, "I Dreamed A Dream" from the musical
"Les Miserables", was posted on YouTube.
</P>
<P>
It has had at least 100 million hits and brought her celebrity fans including
actress Demi Moore and rock star Jon Bon Jovi, who embraced the dowdy spinster
from small-town Scotland with a voice worthy of Broadway.
</P>
<P>
Bookmakers made her the favourite to win, but after an unconvincing semi-final
performance, there were fears that Boyle, who was starved of oxygen at birth and
has mild learning difficulties, was suffering under the pressure.
</P>
<P>
She was spoken to by police after an outburst at the London hotel where she was
staying, while "Britain's Got Talent" judge Piers Morgan described her as "a
frightened rabbit in headlights" and said she considered quitting.
</P>
<P>
In a live performance in the "Britain's Got Talent" final Saturday, though,
Boyle proved the critics wrong and repeated her audition piece with gusto.
</P>
<P>
Judge Amanda Holden said after the performance: "I have never heard such
powerful, confident vocals."
</P>
<P>
Following her performance, Boyle -- wearing a grey-blue, long sequined dress --
gushed appreciation for her worldwide fan base.
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank people for all the support they've given me," she said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if it was worth all the media pressure, she replied: "Well worth it!... I
really feel at home on stage, I'm among friends."
</P>
<P>
As for her future plans, Boyle added: "I hope to get an album out -- I'll just
play it by ear. What a journey -- unbelievable, and very humbling. Thank you for
everything."
</P>
<P>
Simon Cowell, one of the show's judges and its mastermind, said he had high
hopes for Boyle.
</P>
<P>
"It's the biggest phenomenon I've ever seen out of any of my shows," Cowell, who
is also a judge on "American Idol", told the News of the World newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Boyle's performance was watched by hundreds of fans in her home town of
Blackburn, outside Edinburgh, where she lives in social housing with only her
cat Pebbles for company.
</P>
<P>
"She told me that after the final, she wants to come back and resume her
previous life," one of Boyle's neighbours, 24-year-old housewife Vicky McLean
told the Mail on Sunday newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"She doesn't want to make millions and go to America, she just wants to sing. I
think all she really hopes to have out of it is enough money to buy her house."

Japan-based Koreans rally for voting rights
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
tokyo, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ethnic Koreans and foreigners who have gained permanent Japanese residency
rallied in Tokyo Sunday, demanding voting rights in local elections and an end
to what they see as discrimination against them.     Ethnic Koreans make up the
biggest foreign community in Japan, consisting mainly of those who migrated
there when the Korean peninsula was under Japanese rule between 1910-1945, and
their descendants.
</P>
<P>
Although many were born in Japan, they lack voting rights and say they are
subjected to various forms of social and legal discrimination in the country.
</P>
<P>
Three years after South Korea in contrast gave local voting rights to foreigners
with permanent residency, some 900 foreign permanent residents of mostly Korean
descent gathered at a Tokyo conference hall.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult for foreign residents to convey their opinions and problems to
their own municipalities because we still don't have voting rights," said Kim
Jong-soo, chairman of the Korean Youth Association in Japan.
</P>
<P>
"This issue should have been solved way before," he said in an opening speech.
"This is an issue of basic human rights whether the Japanese government and
society see foreign residents as independent human beings or not."
</P>
<P>
Participants of the rally met noisy protests by right-wing nationalist activists
outside the hall. Over 100 activists demonstrated, hoisting rising-sun Japanese
flags and chanting anti-Korean slogans.
</P>
<P>
"Voting rights are for the Japanese!" yelled the protesters.
</P>
<P>
After the rally, the Korean group marched through central Tokyo, also protesting
against North Korea's nuclear tests and missile launches.

Over 40 injured in protests over Kashmiri women's deaths
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Srinagar, India, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 40 people have been wounded in two days of clashes between Indian
police and Kashmiris demonstrating over the recent deaths of two young Muslim
women, police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Police said they have launched an investigation into the "mystery deaths" of the
women, aged 17 and 22. Their families have accused Indian security forces of
abducting, raping and subsequently killing them.
</P>
<P>
Angry demonstrators on Sunday hurled stones at riot police and paramilitary
forces, who retaliated by firing teargas shells and charging at them with
batons.
</P>
<P>
"Over 40 people, including several policemen, have been wounded in two days of
clashes between police and protesters," a Muslim police officer said, requesting
not to be named.
</P>
<P>
Protesters ransacked a government hospital and a number of other government
buildings after the bodies of the women, who were related, were found on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They were fished out from a shallow stream in Shopian town about 50 kilometres
(31 miles) south of the summer capital Srinagar.
</P>
<P>
Their families said the bodies had marks of violence and their clothes were
torn.
</P>
<P>
An autopsy report will be available on Monday, a police statement said.
</P>
<P>
Indian security forces battling militancy in Kashmir have frequently been
accused of committing human rights violations in the scenic Himalayan region.
Officials say they investigate all the cases and punish those found guilty.
</P>
<P>
Kashmir is in the grip of a nearly 20-year insurgency against Indian rule that
has so far left more than 47,000 people dead by official count.
</P>
<P>
The region is ruled in part by Pakistan and India but claimed in full by both.
</P>
<P>
Senior Kashmir minister Ali Sagar said those involved in the two women's
killings will be "given exemplary punishment."

Armenia opposition pins hopes on Yerevan poll
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
YEREVAN, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of the Armenian capital voted in a municipal election Sunday in which
the main opposition movement is seeking to gain an important foothold on power
after losing political ground last year.
</P>
<P>
The Armenian National Congress is hoping it can win enough seats on the 65-seat
Yerevan city council for its leader -- former president Levon Ter-Petrosian --
to be elected mayor.
</P>
<P>
The vote has raised fears of a repeat of the violence after last year's
presidential elections that saw 10 people killed in clashes between riot police
and opposition supporters.
</P>
<P>
Ter-Petrosian and his backers accused the authorities of rigging the vote to
guarantee a win for President Serzh Sarkisian who defeated Ter-Petrosian.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say it is likely the opposition will hold protests if it loses again,
risking another confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Voting began at 8:00 am (0400 GMT) and by three hours later voter turnout had
reached 11.72 percent, the Central Election Commission said.
</P>
<P>
The city council will chose the mayor under constitutional amendments adopted in
2005. Armenia's president previously made the appointment for the four-year
term.
</P>
<P>
If any party wins 40 percent of the seats, its candidate becomes the city mayor,
otherwise the mayor is to be elected by the city council.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results are to be announced within 24 hours after the vote and the
final results during the next seven days.
</P>
<P>
Yerevan's current mayor, Gagik Beglarian, is topping the ruling Republican
party's list in the municipal vote and opinion polls showed him leading.
</P>
<P>
Beglarian told journalists Sunday the vote was proceeding smoothly.
</P>
<P>
"No violations have been observed. The situation is quiet and we can already
observe heavy voter activity," he said.
</P>
<P>
The international community will be watching the vote to see if Armenia is
keeping its commitments on democratic reforms. The observers' delegation
includes the Council of Europe and European Union representatives.

Tennis: Gonzalez outguns Hanescu to reach quarter-finals
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Big-hitting Chilean Fernando Gonzalez outgunned Romania's Victor Hanescu 6-2,
6-4, 6-2 on Sunday to reach the French Open quarter-finals for the third time.
</P>
<P>
The 12th seeded Gonzalez will tackle either British third seed Andy Murray or
Marin Cilic, the 13th seeded Croatian, for a place in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, 28, simply overpowered 30th seed Hanescu, who was bidding to reach his
second quarter-final here after making the last eight in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's result was never in doubt from the time Gonzalez, who lost to Juan
Carlos Ferrero in the 2003 quarter-finals and Roger Federer at the same stage
last year, broke twice in the first four games of the first set to race out to a
4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
With his trademark, booming forehand forcing the beanpole Romanian to scamper
haplessly from side to side, the Chilean wrapped up the opening set in just 25
minutes.
</P>
<P>
A break in the ninth game was enough to decide the second set, as the rallies
remained fierce and short, while another break of the dispirited and one-
dimensional Hanescu in the first game of the third set Gonzalez on his way.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, whose best Grand Slam performance remains his runner-up spot to
Federer at the 2007 Australian Open, broke through again in the seventh game to
stretch to 5-2.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 Roland Garros junior champion then wrapped up the tie with his 50th
winner to finish off Hanescu after only 87 minutes.

Tennis: Cibulkova into last eight at French Open
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia underlined her growing potential on Sunday by
brushing aside Agnes Szavay of Hungary 6-2, 6-4 to reach the quarter-finals of
the French Open.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the 20-year-old from Bratislava has made it through to
the last eight of a Grand Slam event at her eighth attempt.
</P>
<P>
One of the smallest players on the WTA circuit at just 1.61 metres, Cibulkova
had failed to take a set of Szavay in their three previous encounters, but she
was quickly out of the blocks this time breaking serve twice for a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Szavay, who stunned Venus Williams in the third round, steadied the ship in the
fifth game but by that time the first set was out of her reach, Cibulkova taking
it 6-2 in 38 minutes.
</P>
<P>
It was a different story at the start of the second half with Cibulkova
tightening up and dropping serve to go 0-2 down, but she snatched one back in
the next to level at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
The 20th seed then broke again in the fifth game keeping up a steady stream of
baseline groundstrokes and allowing Szavay to make the errors as she sought a
solution to her opponent's dominance of the rallies.
</P>
<P>
There looked to be no way back for the demoralised Hungarian as Cibulkova got to
match point on her own serve at 5-2 ahead.
</P>
<P>
But a wild forehand let that slip away and she followed up with a double fault
at break point to hand her opponent an unlikely lifeline.
</P>
<P>
Szavay staved off another match point on her own serve by coming into the net
more often, but Cibulkova this time held steady on her own service game to set
up a quarter-final tie against either former world No. 1 Maria Sharapova of
Russia or Li Na of China.

Football: New deal for Ballack

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chelsea's German midfielder Michael Ballack, only a substitute for Saturday's FA
Cup final win over Everton, has agreed a one-year contract extension, the BBC
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't signed yet but I have agreed for another year," Ballack, 32, said,
adding he expected AC Milan's Carlo Ancelotti to succeed Guus Hiddink as coach
next season at Stamford Bridge.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't worked under him and I don't know him very well but you can see from
the work he has done at Milan that he is a successful manager," Ballack told BBC
Sport.
</P>
<P>
"It's not done yet but it looks like he will be coach."
</P>
<P>
Ancelotti is set to reveal if he is to take charge after the Serie A season ends
Sunday evening as interim manager Hiddink, who replaced the sacked Luiz Felipe
in February, returns to his job as Russia coach following four months in London.
</P>
<P>
Ballack, signed by Jose Mourinho in 2006, has seen Chelsea win two FA Cups since
but insisted that next season he wants to target bigger prizes with Manchester
United having dominated the English Premiership since his arrival in England.
</P>
<P>
"What we need at Chelsea is consistency," he insisted. "There is not much that
we need to change to win the Premier League next season. We have a great team,
which is the most important thing, but we have to change the manager again and
we will need a bit of time to adapt.
</P>
<P>
"Every coach works with different methods and the players have to get to know
him - hopefully we won't need too much time because if we do we will be a little
bit behind," said Ballack, who indicated he did not think a new coach would need
to go on a spending spree.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we need to buy anybody because we already have a lot of good
players on the bench.
</P>
<P>
"That is for the club to decide but, if you look at the performances over the
last couple of years in reaching finals, we have a really good squad and are
heading in the right direction."

Recession-hit Croatia votes in local polls
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ZAGREB, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Croatians cast ballots on Sunday in a second round of local and regional
elections, including a mayoral race in the capital Zagreb, which are expected to
be influenced by the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The elections are seen as a test of the ability of the Croatia's governing
coalition to handle the effects of the global economic crisis, which sent the
Adriatic country into recession late last year.
</P>
<P>
Some four million voters were eligible to elect 221 mayors and municipal heads.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations opened at 0500 GMT and were to close 12 hours later. First
results were expected later on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At 0900 GMT, four hours after voting started, turnout was at 10.8 percent, the
electoral commission said. It was some three percent lower than in the first
round voting held two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
In Zagreb, incumbent mayor Milan Bandic of the opposition Social Democrats (SDP)
is being tipped to see off a challenge from independent candidate Josip Kregar
and win a fourth mandate.
</P>
<P>
On May 17, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader's ruling conservative Croatian Democratic
Union (HDZ) was re-elected in most counties in the first round while the SDP
asserted their control in major cities.
</P>
<P>
The HDZ and its coalition partners won seven prefect posts and held a majority
in 14 out of 21 county assemblies. The SDP got four county prefects and secured
control of five county assemblies.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives lost the mayoral post in the country's second biggest town of
Split, on the Adriatic coast, where an SDP candidate is to face an independent.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said the vote confirmed that the SDP and left bloc dominate in
more developed parts of Croatia as well as in cities, while the HDZ and right-
wing parties are more popular in less developed and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The polls give voters the right for the first time to directly elect mayors,
county prefects and municipal heads, along with 21 county assemblies and more
than 550 city and town councils.
</P>
<P>
The HDZ, founded by late nationalist leader Franjo Tudjman, returned to power in
2003 after three years in opposition. Sanader has since shaken off the HDZ's
hardline nationalist legacy and transformed it into a party that is aiming to
lead Croatia to becoming the European Union's 28th member by 2011.

Israel fumes over US settlement demands
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Jerusalem, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israel refused on Sunday to bow to US calls for a freeze to all settlement
activity in the occupied West Bank, as it fumed over the "unfair" demands that
have raised tensions between the close allies.
</P>
<P>
"I want to say in a crystal clear manner that the current Israeli government
will not accept in any fashion that legal settlement activity be frozen," said
Transport Minister Yisrael Katz, a close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The premier himself did not address the issue at the opening of the weekly
cabinet meeting but the fighting words were echoed by other members of the
largely right-wing cabinet, including from its most liberal party, Labour.
</P>
<P>
A senior Israeli official complained that Washington under President Barack
Obama -- who has vowed to pursue Middle East peace talks as part of a changed
approach to the region -- was placing unfair demands on its close ally.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans have demanded almost nothing from the Palestinians but are asking
Israel to take steps that are a real sacrifice. These demands are unfair," he
told AFP on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians are taking a passive approach. They're not even ready to meet
the Israeli side and Abu Mazen (Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas) wants the
Americans to do all the work," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abbas, who met Obama last week, 10 days after the US president met Netanyahu,
has vowed that that he will not relaunch talks unless Israel freezes settlements
in the occupied West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Obama administration has demanded that Israel stop all its activity in the
settlements, including the so-called natural growth construction that allows for
building to accommodate a growing population.
</P>
<P>
The unusually blunt talk over one of the top stumbling points in the stalled
Middle East peace process has raised alarm bells in Israel that the new US
president could put pressure on the Jewish state as part of his new approach to
the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
"This is an unjustifiable demand that the government and the public do not
accept," Interior Minister Eli Yishai of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party.
</P>
<P>
Social Affairs Minister Isaac Herzog of the centre-left Labour party that is the
most liberal in Netanyahu's government, said that "one has to understand that
there are various statuses within the settlements" and "saying that the picture
is black and white or write or wrong is wrong."
</P>
<P>
More than 280,000 Israelis live in settlements dotted throughout the West Bank,
which Israel captured in war in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Although the international community considers all settlements illegal, Israel
makes a distinction between those that were built with the state's blessing and
outposts, those constructed without authorisation.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said he would dismantle outposts, but that it made "no sense" to
ask for a complete freeze to construction.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have also complained that Obama's administration has yet to
say it will honour commitments in a letter that then US president George W. Bush
sent to then Israeli premier Ariel Sharon in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Bush said that given the existence of major settlement blocs in the West Bank it
was "unrealistic" to expect Israel to fully withdraw from the territory as part
of a final peace deal.
</P>
<P>
"This administration has not yet recognised the arrangements made between the
Israeli government and the Bush administration," said Katz. "That can only raise
concerns over future arrangements."
</P>
<P>
Aside from the settlements, there is stark disagreement between Washington and
Israel over the creation of a Palestinian state, with Obama repeatedly saying he
was committed to the principle and Netanyahu thus far refusing to endorse it in
public.
</P>
<P>
Obama is due in Saudi Arabia and Egypt this week to try to reach out to Muslims
and end the deep mistrust of the United States felt across much of the Islamic
world.

Palestinian tensions mount after deadly shoot-out
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NABLUS, West Bank, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six people were killed in a West Bank shoot-out on Sunday during an arrest
operation for a senior Hamas militant, deepening the rift between the rival
Palestinian factions.
</P>
<P>
The Islamist Hamas movement ruling the Gaza Strip warned that the rival Fatah
movement loyal to president Mahmud Abbas had crossed a "red line" by carrying
out the operation which killed two of its members.
</P>
<P>
Hamas-Fatah ties sharply deteriorated after the Islamists seized control of Gaza
in deadly June 2007 clashes and the Palestinian split is one of the main
stumbling blocks in reaching a final Middle East peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The gunfight erupted when police tried to arrest Mohammed al-Samman, the
commander of Hamas's armed wing in the northern West Bank who was also on
Israel's wanted list, Palestinian police and Hamas said.
</P>
<P>
Samman barricaded himself in a house in the town of Qalqiliya in the north of
the Israeli-occupied territory together with Mohammed Yassin, another Hamas
militant and refused to come out, they said.
</P>
<P>
The ensuing shoot-out killed both Hamas men, three Palestinian policemen and a
civilian. A curfew was imposed on the town near the border with Israel following
the incident, police said.
</P>
<P>
Hamas lashed out over the incident.
</P>
<P>
"This crime is a red line," the Islamists said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Hamas puts the complete responsibility of this ugly crime on Abbas and his
security forces."
</P>
<P>
Describing Abbas and his forces as agents of arch-enemy Israel, Hamas warned it
would respond "with acts," without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
"There is no difference between the occupation who shoots and the people who
carry out their missions for them," a spokesman for Hamas's armed wing said at a
press conference in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever touches our fighters should wait for the answer of the resistance."
</P>
<P>
Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhum said there was no chance of further reconciliation
talks with Fatah after the "escalation by security services of Abu Mazen and
Fatah against Hamas and its leaders in the West Bank."
</P>
<P>
"Fatah should choose -- dialogue with us or doing the dirty work of the Zionist
enemy," Barhum said as Hamas decried the killing over mosque loudspeakers in
Gaza City.
</P>
<P>
A senior Palestinian Authority official brushed off the Hamas accusations as
"lies."
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian Authority has one duty -- to impose security and the law and we
will not allow what happened in Gaza to happen here in the West Bank under any
circumstances," he said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow for any kind of chaos."
</P>
<P>
The two factions have been divided since June 2007, when Hamas booted Abbas's
secular Fatah party out of Gaza, leaving him in control only in the occupied
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
They held five rounds of talks under Egyptian mediation in an attempt to
reconcile but to no avail and the two sides have frequently accused their rivals
of campaigns of persecution.
</P>
<P>
In a recent report, Amnesty International rights group lambasted both Hamas and
Fatah for arbitrary detentions, torture and suppression of freedom of speech in
their respective areas of control.
</P>
<P>
The Western-backed Abbas swore in a new Palestinian cabinet that includes
members of Fatah but not Hamas on May 20, further widening the sectarian rift.

Iran defuses bomb in plane toilet
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tehran, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iranian security officials defused a bomb planted on a domestic passenger plane,
officials said on Sunday, the latest incident of violence ahead of next month's
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The attempted bomb attack occurred on Saturday on a Kish Air flight headed to
Tehran from the oil-rich western city of Ahvaz near the border with Iraq, the
Fars news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Last night, 15 minutes after the plane with 131 passengers took off, flight
security guards found a handmade bomb placed in the lavatory," Fars said. "The
plane landed immediately at Ahvaz airport and the bomb was defused."
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred just two days after 25 people were killed in a powerful
bomb attack on a mosque in Zahedan in southeastern Iran claimed by a shadowy
Sunni rebel group.
</P>
<P>
"Security officials of the Islamic Republic Revolutionary Guards acted well and
the incident caused no casualties," Reza Jafarzadeh, spokesman for Iran's Civil
Aviation Organisation, told the state broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
A top security official blamed Iran's "enemies" for the plane bomb, saying they
wanted to stoke tensions ahead of the June 12 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"The suspicious package and the details of the sabotage operation in the Tehran-
Ahvaz Boeing is under investigation," Mohammad Hassan Kazemi, the head of the
Revolutionary Guards aviation security operations, told the official IRNA news
agency.
</P>
<P>
"I do not confirm a link between this and the Zahedan operation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we believe our enemies want to create a threatening environment before the
presidential election and exploit the open space in the country and spark
despair among people."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a suicide bomber killed 25 worshippers and wounded 125 in a Shiite
mosque in Zahedan, capital of the southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan province
bordering Afghanistan and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
A day later, gunmen on motorbikes fired at an election campaign office of
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Zahedan and wounded two campaign members and a
child.
</P>
<P>
The province, which is home to Iran's Baluch minority who adhere to Sunni Islam,
has been the scene of a deadly insurgency by a Sunni rebel group which is
strongly opposed to the government of predominantly Shiite Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran on Saturday hanged three men in public accused of involvement in Thursday's
mosque bombing, just 48 hours after the attack, which was reportedly claimed by
the Sunni group Jundullah (Soldiers of God).
</P>
<P>
Iran summoned Pakistani envoy Mohammad Bakhsh Abbasi following the bombing.
Iranian officials claim Jundallah is known to have operated on several occasions
from across the broder in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The mosque attack was reminiscent of a similar outbreak of violence just days
before Iran's last presidential election in 2005 which brought Ahmadinejad to
power.
</P>
<P>
Bombs hit Tehran and Ahvaz, which has a sizable Arab minority, in June 2005,
killing at least eight people and wounding scores more.
</P>
<P>
Ahvaz, the capital of Iran's oil-rich Khuzestan province, which borders Iraq and
the Gulf, was also rocked by ethnic violence in April 2005.
</P>
<P>
Iran in the past has blamed US and British agents in neighbouring Iraq and
Afghanistan for launching attacks on its border provinces with significant
ethnic minority populations.
</P>
<P>
Jalal Sayah, Sistan-Baluchestan's deputy governor, said on Friday that those
arrested over the Zahedan attack were "hired by America and the agents of the
arrogance."
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials usually use the term "global arrogance" to refer to Iran's
arch-foe the United States.
</P>
<P>
But US State Department spokesman Ian Kelly denied Washington was behind the
attack, saying the United States does "not sponsor any form of terrorism in
Iran."
</P>
<P>
Iranian armed forces chief General Hassan Firouzabadi, in comments reported on
Saturday, accused Britain and "Zionists" of involvement in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Sistan-Baluchestan has a substantial Sunni minority and lies on a major
narcotics-smuggling route from Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Breakaway South Ossetia votes for parliament
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TSKHINVALI, Georgia, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rebel Georgian region of South Ossetia voted Sunday in polls that could
secure the grip of its separatist leader nine months after it was the subject of
war between Russia and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The local opposition says Eduard Kokoity is seeking to use the legislative
elections to forge a loyal parliamentary majority to push through an amendment
allowing him to run again for office when his second term lapses next year.
</P>
<P>
Russia -- which outraged the West by recognising South Ossetia as independent in
the wake of August's war with Georgia  --- has said South Ossetia should not
amend the existing term limits in its constitution.
</P>
<P>
Four parties are competing for the 34 seats in the parliament, but the central
election commission has barred the only two parties not loyal to Kokoity.
</P>
<P>
Opposition activities said voting would not make a difference. "I plan to sit at
home. There's nothing we can do," said Alan Gassiyev, an opposition leader,
calling the polls "completely illegal."
</P>
<P>
"It's too bad if he wants to change the constitution," added Grigory Dzassokhov,
a 55-year old former history teacher. "It would be nonsense. What kind of
democracy is that?"
</P>
<P>
Critics accuse Kokoity, an ex-wrestling champion, of muzzling opponents and
stealing the money sent from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Georgia ridiculed the vote, with the country's reintegration minister Temur
Iakobashvili saying the elections were "nothing but clownery, a farce and a
redistribution of a criminal power."
</P>
<P>
Kokoity insisted however the elections were in strict accordance with law,
saying the polls were "a maturity test for the small independent state."
</P>
<P>
A large number of voters at the polling stations was proof that the vote was
deemed genuine by people, he said.
</P>
<P>
"At 10:00 am I can already say there's a very high turnout," he added. Officials
said it already amounted to 19 percent by that time.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-eight polling stations have been set up for the region's 50,000 residents
as well as additional sites in Russia for expatriates and refugees from the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
Kokoity currently does not have the two-thirds of seats in the parliament to
amend the constitution.
</P>
<P>
As the region scrambles to rebuild itself in the aftermath of the war, the
opposition accuses Kokoity and his circle of diverting lorries carrying
construction material and humanitarian aid to traffic the goods in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Out of over 10 billion rubles (320 million dollars, 230 million euros) in aid
money budgeted by Moscow, South Ossetian authorities say they have spent just
1.5 billion rubles.
</P>
<P>
Kokoity -- who built connections in Moscow working as a trade official for the
rebel region when it was known as a highway for smuggling in the early 1990s --
has rejected accusations against him as Georgian propaganda.
</P>
<P>
"With what happened in August we need three to four years to rebuild," Kokoity
said.
</P>
<P>
And as the looming political scandal in the region threatens to become an
embarrassment for Moscow, there are signs that the Kremlin is scaling back its
support for the South Ossetian leader.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Naryshkin, the head of the Russian presidential administration, said on
Russian television this month that South Ossetia should not amend the existing
term limits in its constitution.
</P>
<P>
Moscow and Tbilisi fought a brief but intense war last August over the region,
which had enjoyed de facto independence since the early 1990s thanks to tacit
Russian support.
</P>
<P>
Following the conflict Russia formally recognised the region as independent, a
move followed only by Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Russia took formal control of guarding its borders this month, in a move
condemned by the West as a violation of an EU-brokered ceasefire that ended the
fighting last August.
</P>
<P>
The vote was a leading news item on the Russian television, which gave it
favorable coverage.
</P>
<P>
Voting was expected to end at 8:00 pm (1600 GMT), with the first results
expected two hours later.

Israel stages 'doomsday' drill
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Jerusalem, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israel began its largest-ever exercise on Sunday to test the response of
emergency services to a "doomsday" mix of missile attacks, suicide bombings and
natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The five-day exercise will simulate simultaneous rocket strikes from the Gaza
Strip and Lebanon and missile attacks from arch-foes Syria and Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The mere fact that Israel is preparing with such an exercise improves our
ability to better protect our citizens and ultimately lowers the threat," Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the drill, Israel will be staging a "doomsday scenario" of simultaneous
strikes against the country, defence ministry spokesman Shlomo Dror told AFP
last week.
</P>
<P>
This will include conventional, chemical and biological strikes, as well as a
wave of Palestinian suicide bombings, against large population centres.
</P>
<P>
Exercise Turning Point 3 will also simulate the conduct of rescue and medical
services during earthquakes and epidemics and will involve the participation of
schools, government ministers and other state institutions.
</P>
<P>
The drill's main activity will come on Tuesday, when air-raid sirens sound
across the country and citizens must scramble to shelters, in some areas within
seconds and others within no more than three minutes.
</P>
<P>
There will also be simulated cabinet meetings in which ministers will weigh
their response to such attacks and scenarios.
</P>
<P>
"Schools, kindergartens and educational institutions across Israel will
participate in the exercise, practising emergency entry into protected spaces,"
the army said in a statement. "Rear military bases, governmental offices and
public institutions will also practice."
</P>
<P>
It is the third consecutive year Israel is conducting such an exercise, although
this year's drill is the largest-ever.
</P>
<P>
"It is an important exercise and it is good that it is happening at this time,"
Defence Minister Ehud Barak said.
</P>
<P>
The manoeuvres were first held in the aftermath of the July-August 2006 war with
Lebanon's Hezbollah militia, which revealed major weaknesses in how the Jewish
state's homefront dealt with the rocket attacks.
</P>
<P>
"The Second Lebanon War revealed that the homefront was not well prepared for
war and citizens found it hard to adapt to the special situation," Dror said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defence Minister Matan Vilnai told army radio on Sunday that "our enemies
think that the rear is our weak point, we have to reinforce this front and be
ready to face any situation."
</P>
<P>
The drill comes just two weeks after the air force wrapped up a massive four-day
exercise that tested its ability to defend against missile and jet strikes from
Syria and Iran.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the army has simulated strikes from the Islamic republic,
located more than 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) away.
</P>
<P>
Israel considers Iran its biggest threat and is a leading campaigner against its
nuclear programme, which it suspects is a cover for ambitions to build atomic
weapons, charges vehemently denied by Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state is itself regarded as having the strongest military in the
Middle East and is believed to have a nuclear arsenel which it has never
confirmed or denied.

French police said Sunday they made a dozen arrests overnight in the

Once mighty US auto industry faces day of reckoning
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The once mighty US auto industry faces a day of reckoning on Monday with the
looming bankruptcy of General Motors and an expected court ruling on the sale of
Chrysler to a group led by Italy's Fiat.
</P>
<P>
The global economic crisis has hit the US industry hard, prompting massive
intervention by President Barack Obama's administration to prevent total
collapse and a new blow to the nation's economy, which is already in recession.
</P>
<P>
A government rescue plan for GM could put as much as 72.5 percent of the
country's biggest automaker under state ownership.
</P>
<P>
With the hours counting down for GM, company bondholders with slightly more than
50 percent of GM’s 27.2 billion dollars in bond debt voted Saturday in support
of the restructuring plan, The New York Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Among the backers was a committee of large investors holding about 20 percent of
GM’s outstanding bonds, The Times said.
</P>
<P>
No official announcement of the vote tally has yet been made.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the bondholders would obtain the rights to buy an extra 15
percent of GM's stock at a low price. They would also control 25 percent of the
new GM, after having supported the new company's creation in bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
Recalcitrant bondholders who opt for confrontation rather than cooperation "will
get nothing or very little," an Obama administration official told reporters
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Government-backed restructuring in bankruptcy court for GM, once the world's
largest automaker, appeared all but certain.
</P>
<P>
Monday marks a deadline imposed by the Obama administration for the company to
submit a viable restructuring plan or file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a US bankruptcy court judge in New York was widely expected to
approve a deal between Chrysler and Fiat on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The third biggest US automaker has declared bankruptcy and is seeking a tie-up
with Fiat in a plan presented as the only way to save the company from
liquidation.
</P>
<P>
Developments at Chrysler could provide an example for restructuring at GM, which
will similarly have to sell some of its brands and close many dealerships.
</P>
<P>
But the administration official said a 60- to 90-day timeframe was "better" for
GM, contrasted with the fast-track process for Chrysler, which filed for
bankruptcy protection on April 30.
</P>
<P>
"This is a much more complicated company than Chrysler, as a global company.
It's three times the size," noted the official.
</P>
<P>
The United Auto Workers (UAW) union said Friday its members ratified a deal to
allow GM to radically cut costs and its debt load, clearing the way for a quick
exit from the expected bankruptcy filing.
</P>
<P>
GM also announced plans to retool an idled US plant to build small cars it had
originally planned to import, and two more US assembly plants could  potentially
be saved.
</P>
<P>
The automaker, which normally shuts downs plants for two weeks during the
summer, is planning longer-than-normal closures at a variety of facilities this
summer, The Detroit Free Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Some factories will be shut down for as long as nine weeks, according to the
newspaper report. This week, about eight out of its 15 assembly plants will be
running.
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy filing could also be sped up by a deal struck Saturday after
marathon talks that saw Canadian parts maker Magna and its Russian backers
taking over GM's Opel.
</P>
<P>
The deal for GM's European operations, brokered by the German government,
amounted to a major development in the remaking of the global auto industry.
</P>
<P>
GM employs some 50,000 people throughout Europe and Magna plans to cut about a
fifth.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose government agreed to stump billions of
euros (dollars) in loan guarantees and emergency loans to keep the ailing Opel
afloat, acknowledged that talks over the future of GM Europe had sometimes been
difficult.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck had even denounced what he called
"scandalous" US negotiating tactics.
</P>
<P>
Yet despite what she called "huge mismanagement" by GM executives, a telephone
call to Obama helped seal the deal, Merkel said.
</P>
<P>
As for Chrysler, a new company could be born within days of approval for
bankruptcy. The Treasury said it had transferred 6.9 billion dollars in public
funds to New Carco, a newly created company to acquire Chrysler's "good assets."
</P>
<P>
If presiding judge Arthur Gonzalez rules against Chrysler, it faces a grim
future, with a worst-case scenario being Fiat abandoning the tie-up and the US
automaker going into liquidation, with massive job losses.
</P>
<P>
Legal appeals were expected if Gonzalez ruled in favor, meaning possible new
delays. Fiat has said it might back out if the transaction is not completed by
June 15.

Turks suspicious of West, radical Islam: poll
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Ankara, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Turks covet religion and are deeply suspicious of the West, but believe radical
Islam poses threats to their country and the world, according to a poll
published Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of poll respondents -- 76 and 86 percent respectively
-- believe the European Union and the United States aim to divide their country,
Milliyet newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is seeking to join the EU and the United States is among the country's
NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Istanbul's Bahcesehir University among 1,715 people in
April and May, found that 62 percent see religion as their top value, followed
by secularism and democracy at 16 and 13 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-two percent said it was appropriate for Muslim women to cover their heads
outside home, while 58 percent considered it a "sin" for women to wear bathsuits
at the beach, Milliyet reported.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-two percent said they would not wish to have alcohol-consuming
neighbours.
</P>
<P>
Some 66 percent said they would not welcome non-religious neighbours and 67
percent said the same for unmarried couples living together, Milliyet reported.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that 64 percent do not wish to live next door to a Jew, 52
percent to a Christian, 42 percent to an American and 26 percent to anyone of a
different ethnicity or race.
</P>
<P>
But despite their conservative inclinations, the majority also expressed fears
over radical Islam and attacks on democracy.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-nine percent said extremist Islamist movements pose either a "great" or a
"certain" threat to Turkey, and a slightly smaller majority believed so for the
world.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent said "anti-democratic actions and thoughts" are a threat for
Turkey.

Football: Bordeaux's champion vintage ripens with Blanc
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bordeaux, which produces an estimated 700 million bottles of wine each year, may
be best known in gastronomic circles for its distinct clarets.
</P>
<P>
But in the world of French football this year's top vintage is a Blanc.
</P>
<P>
In leading Bordeaux to the French league title for the first time in a decade
Laurent Blanc has pulled off a double coup.
</P>
<P>
Not only has he taken the Girondins to glory in only his second season as a
coach but the 43-year-old from Ales has also managed to cure a bout of
nationwide yawning stretching back to 2002.
</P>
<P>
That year, Lyon won their first ever league title after some near misses and
romped past all-comers for the next six years.
</P>
<P>
But this year was no one horse race, with Blanc's men landing the crown after a
final-day win over relegated Caen gave them 80 points from 38 matches to 77 for
Marseille and 71 for Lyon, who next season will have to play in the Champions
League qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
"I am really delighted," said Blanc, who pinpointed the win over Lyon five weeks
ago as the moment he felt his men were destined to end up as top dogs.
</P>
<P>
"Last year we lost both matches to Lyon, our direct rivals, even if maybe we
didn't deserve to. Then, when Marseille lost to Lyon, that opened the way up for
us," noted Blanc, a mainstay of the French side which won the 1998 World Cup and
Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
Blanc, who suggested it would be very difficult to replicate Lyon's long run of
titles, said rigorous hard work in training over the winter had been key.
</P>
<P>
"We really put in some physical grind in January. What also helped was that we
only really realised quite late in the day just what a great run we were on, so
we were under less pressure. And mentally we were very strong - several times we
turned things around right at the death when things weren't going well."
</P>
<P>
Two defeats in their first four games saw Bordeaux make not the brightest of
starts and by the end of September they had eight points to make up on Lyon, who
retained the margin going into December.
</P>
<P>
A pre-Christmas purple patch saw Bordeaux close to within three points but draws
against struggling Grenoble and Saint Etienne held up progress as Marseille
soared into top spot.
</P>
<P>
By April, Lyon were fading, their confidence dented by yet another failure to
impress in Europe as Barcelona dumped them easily in the Champions League second
phase, leaving Bordeaux and Marseille to scrap it out.
</P>
<P>
Lyon then ultimately did Bordeaux a decisive favour with a May 17 win at
Marseille's seething Stade Velodrome to prepare the coronation which came with
Saturday's denouement, Yoan Gouffran securing the title after a club record 11th
consecutive league win.
</P>
<P>
Gilding Bordeaux's lily was a League Cup win in April while a further bonus was
last week's signing up of star playmaker Yoann Gourcuff, who had only been on
loan from AC Milan and who has been the French league's shining star this term.
</P>
<P>
But now they will be judged on whether they can do what Lyon have consistently
failed to do - make a good impression in the Champions League.
</P>
<P>
Lyon have never made it past the quarter-finals while 1993 winners Marseille
remain the only French side to lift the European Cup.
</P>
<P>
Despite his relative touchline inexperience going into that challenge, Blanc
will take heart from the success of Barcelona's 38-year-old Pep Guardiola, who
outfoxed Sir Alex Ferguson to land the trophy in his debut season as a coach.
</P>
<P>
For Bordeaux, triumphing in Europe will demand a different, more elastic
mentality from that which suffices for domestic fare and they will be only too
aware the transition has traditionally proved awkward for French clubs.
</P>
<P>
That might be down to cultural issues for, as any Frenchman knows, the first
course is normally washed down with a glass of rouge.
</P>
<P>
But with Blanc's coaching genius out of the bottle, Bordeaux are now eying
dessert.
</P>
<P>
That would normally mean sampling any one of a host of the south west's finest
vins blancs - although lifting the Champions League would surely demand an
'upgrade' to champagne.

Indian court rules schools can bar Sikhs who pluck eyebrows
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New Delhi, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Indian court has upheld a decision by a religious body to deny a female
student who plucked her eyebrows admission to a Sikh university, media reports
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The ruling said faith-based educational institutions had the right to refuse
admission to students who did not meet religious standards, as "maintaining hair
unshorn is an essential component of the Sikh religion," according to the Press
Trust of India.
</P>
<P>
The policy had been challenged by Gurleen Kaur after she was denied admission to
the Sri Guru Ram Das Institute of Medical Sciences and Research in the Sikh holy
city of Amritsar.
</P>
<P>
Kaur was excluded on the grounds that she was not a "true Sikh as she was
plucking her eyebrows," according to the Times of India.
</P>
<P>
Sikhism requires men and women to keep their hair uncut at all times, and many
men sport lengthy beards and wear turbans to cover their long hair.
</P>
<P>
Kaur's petition was supported by male students who had also been refused
admission to the university because they trimmed their beards.
</P>
<P>
The Punjab and Haryana High Court, which jointly serves both states, said it was
"perfectly legitimate" for Sikh organisations to refuse any benefit to members
of the community who did not strictly adhere to religious tenets.
</P>
<P>
Avtar Singh Makkar, the head of the Sikh body which administers the college in
Amritsar, said he was happy with the judgment.
</P>
<P>
"Our stand that unshorn hair is of paramount importance for Sikhs has been
vindicated," the Times quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
About 24 million people follow the Sikh faith in India, with a majority of them
living in the state of Punjab.

Sri Lanka rejects rights probe after crushing Tigers
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Colombo, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sri Lanka on Sunday rejected growing calls to probe human rights violations amid
allegations that thousands of civilians perished in the final battle against
Tamil separatists.
</P>
<P>
Media Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said organisations calling for
investigations had "ulterior motives," and dismissed demands for independent
probes into the final phase of Sri Lanka's war against Tamil separatists.
</P>
<P>
"Those who give various civilian casualty figures and call for these probes must
have ulterior motives," Abeywardena told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
He said the government itself was in the process of assessing the civilian
casualties, but gave no figures.
</P>
<P>
"Our officials knew how many people were in the (war zone) area and we are
taking a tally on the number of people now in the IDP (internally displaced
persons) camps," Abeywardena said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came a day after the London-based rights group, Amnesty
International, called for an independent probe into the number of civilians
killed while government forces crushed Tamil Tiger rebels two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty also urged the United Nations to reveal its own estimates for civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
The rights group's Asia Pacific director Sam Zarifi accused both sides of war
crimes and called for an independent international probe.
</P>
<P>
A report in the Times of London newspaper on Friday citing confidential UN
reports said that more than 20,000 non-combatants were killed by Sri Lankan army
shelling in May.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka rejected the Times report as "way out" and managed last week to defeat
a censure move by Western nations before the UN human rights council in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty said it continues to receive reports of widespread human rights
violations, with more than 280,000 people displaced by the recent fighting and
now restricted to state-run camps in the island's north.

Kuwait ruler urges end to political crises

<TEXT>
<P>
The Kuwaiti emir opened on Sunday the new parliament, calling on lawmakers to
end political turmoil that has rocked the oil-rich Gulf state and focus on
economic development.
</P>
<P>
"We must overcome this phase with all its ramifications and open a new page to
build the nation," the emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, told the new
parliament which was elected on May 16 in snap polls
</P>
<P>
The election, the third in the past three years, was called after the emir
dissolved the previous parliament following a standoff between MPs and the
government.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Sabah said that the cornerstone for forging ahead with stalled
development programmes is through a strong cooperation between the government
and the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Four women made history when they won seats for the first time in the 50-member
parliament, while the election saw the Sunni Islamists reduced to a minority.
</P>
<P>
Three Islamist MPs raised objections when two female MPs and a minister showed
up at the inaugural session without the hijab, or head cover, accusing them of
violating the election law that requires women to abide by Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Nasser Mohammad al-Ahmad al-Sabah, a nephew of the emir,
said his government wants to cooperate with the new parliament to get the
country back on development track.
</P>
<P>
But even before new MPs and ministers took the oath, 14 lawmakers walked out of
the session in protest against the government's failure to submit its programme
and a delayed five-year development plan.
</P>
<P>
The new parliament is due to vote on a multi-billion dollar economic stimulus
bill which was issued by the previous government.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, which says it sits on 10 percent of global crude reserves, pumps about
2.2 million barrels of oil daily. It has 1.1 million of native population
besides 2.35 of foreign residents.

<P>
Sudan on Sunday buried former president Gaafar al-Nimeiry, the man who imposed
Islamic rule on Africa's largest nation, at a funeral attended by ordinary
Sudanese, politicians and military officials.
</P>
<P>
"There is no God but Allah," chanted about 3,000 men dressed in traditional
white robes, as well military officers, policemen and a handful of politicians
gathered at a stadium in Omdurman, Khartoum's twin city.
</P>
<P>
President Omar al-Beshir led the funeral procession as Nimeiry's body, wrapped
in a Sudanese flag, was carried through the city by military officials to his
burial site.
</P>
<P>
Nimeiry, who died on Saturday at the age of 79 after a long illness, came to
power in a coup in 1969 with the support of communist and socialist leaders, and
was ousted by another coup in 1985.

Troops hunt Taliban as Pakistan says victory nears
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PESHAWAR, Pakistan, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pakistan's defence secretary said Sunday that a month-long offensive to crush
Taliban fighters in the northwest could end within days, as security forces
hunted down the militant leadership.
</P>
<P>
Swat valley's main town Mingora is back in government hands, the military
announced late Saturday, and Syed Athar Ali told a security forum in Singapore
that three targeted northwest districts were almost clear of Taliban rebels.
</P>
<P>
"Operations in Swat, Buner and adjoining areas have almost met complete
success," the secretary of defence said.
</P>
<P>
"Only five to ten percent job is remaining and hopefully within the next two to
three days these pockets of resistance will be cleared."
</P>
<P>
The army remains locked in battle in some areas, but the fall of Mingora was a
critical milestone in an offensive launched after the Taliban thrust to within
100 kilometres (60 miles) of Islamabad in April.
</P>
<P>
Security officials also reported that 45 militants were killed in fierce
fighting in South Waziristan near the Afghan border, a bolt-hole for Taliban and
Al-Qaeda-linked militants south of the current army bombardment.
</P>
<P>
Washington, which is firmly backing the military drive, had warned that the
rebels threatened Pakistan's very existence and identified the country and
Afghanistan as central to its 'war on terror'.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to target the top leadership of militants and they are constantly
being followed," chief military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said as he
announced the Mingora win.
</P>
<P>
Officials said lower-ranking leaders had been killed but it was harder to get to
the top leaders, who had a network of hardcore militants around them and had
slipped into the rugged mountain terrain.
</P>
<P>
"They will be eliminated wherever we find them," said one military official, who
did not wish to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media, adding:
"We believe that they are somewhere in the mountains."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has slapped a 600,000-dollar price on the head of firebrand Swat
Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah for masterminding the nearly two-year
uprising in the valley to enforce sharia law.
</P>
<P>
Fazlullah led thousands of supporters, a mixture of hardcore ideologues and
disenfranchised young men, in a brutal campaign that has beheaded opponents,
burned scores of schools and fought government troops since November 2007.
</P>
<P>
The government has also offered rewards for 21 rebel chiefs -- wanted dead or
alive -- from Swat.
</P>
<P>
But as the government ups its campaign to stamp out the militants, fears are
growing of a wave of revenge attacks.
</P>
<P>
The northwestern capital Peshawar and the eastern cultural centre of Lahore have
both been rocked by deadly explosions in the last five days, killing a total of
39 people and wounding hundreds more.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Pakistan Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud -- who has a five-
million-dollar bounty on his head posted by the United States -- has claimed
Wednesday's suicide bombing on a police building in Lahore.
</P>
<P>
Hakimullah Mehsud also warned of more "massive attacks" to revenge the Swat
military operation and in protest at Islamabad's ties with Washington.
</P>
<P>
In South Waziristan on Sunday, police official Syed Ahmad said that 45 militants
and two soldiers were killed as security forces repulsed an attack on army
posts.
</P>
<P>
Fears that the current army offensive could expand into Waziristan have already
sent thousands of people there fleeing their homes, although the military have
denied any movements in the tribal belt are imminent.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2.4 million people have already fled the current offensive.
</P>
<P>
The military said it had relaxed its strict curfew Sunday in most parts of the
northwest including Mingora to allow people trapped on the roads to return home
or leave the region.
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday, Taliban militants attacked a school in Hangu town south of
Peshawar, killing one administrator and kidnapping three other people, local
policeman Shoukat Hussain said.
</P>
<P>
In North Waziristan, meanwhile, a former government doctor and an Afghan
national were killed by suspected militants, officials said.

British PM says won't quit despite expenses row, dire polls
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown insisted Sunday he would not quit despite a
rumbling scandal over MPs expenses and dire poll ratings for his ruling Labour
Party ahead of European and local elections.
</P>
<P>
He said the expenses furore was "appalling" and "offends everything that I
believe in" as well as promising that every lawmaker would be forced to account
for all their expenses from the last four years.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13 lawmakers from Labour and the main opposition Conservatives have
said they will stand down since the scandal broke over three weeks ago.
The Daily Telegraph newspaper has been publishing leaked documents detailing
hundreds of claims from the public purse for everything from moat cleaning to a
duck island.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Telegraph published an ICM poll suggesting Labour would come
third in the European elections, in which Britons vote Thursday, with just 17
percent, behind the second opposition centrist Liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Even more damagingly, it suggested Labour would also come third in a general
election with just 22 percent of the vote -- the worst Labour has done in an
opinion poll since 1987.
</P>
<P>
But Brown dismissed suggestions he could step down to make way for a more
popular leader in an interview with BBC television.
</P>
<P>
"Things go up and down," he said. "We're going through the most difficult
economic circumstances the country has faced.
</P>
<P>
"People are angry rightly because they are worried when they see taxpayers'
money wasted on their MPs and they're finding it very difficult for them in a
difficult economic situation."
</P>
<P>
Brown added: "I did not come into politics to allow a situation to develop where
MPs ran away with money they did not deserve".
</P>
<P>
He also said he wanted to introduce a "constitutional renewal" bill and was
looking at reforms including the case for a written constitution, votes at 16
and reform of the unelected upper chamber the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
Brown said he does "not accept the case for an unelected House of Lords", adding
he was "always open" to arguments for reforming of the voting system.
</P>
<P>
Turnout at European elections in Britain is usually low -- in the last polls in
2004, it was just 38 percent, due in part to strong Eurosceptic sentiment among
many. This time, fringe parties like the anti-EU UK Independence Party and the
far-right British National Party are expected to benefit.
</P>
<P>
An Economist magazine/YouGov poll last week found that only 31 percent of
Britons think its membership of the European Union is a good thing, compared to
37 percent who think it is bad.

Thousands hit by diarrhoea outbreak after Bangladesh cyclone
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
KOYRA, Bangladesh, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An outbreak of diarrhoea has spread across Bangladesh's south-west after a
cyclone slammed into the south of the country and neighbouring India earlier in
the week, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At least 237 people were killed after Cyclone Aila on Monday hit the low-lying
coast north of the Bay of Bengal, where a military and civilian relief operation
is now underway.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said diarrhoea had broken out at an "alarming rate" as inundation and
waterlogging in a vast swathe of land close to the world's largest mangrove
forest Sundarbans has destroyed supplies of drinking water.
</P>
<P>
In the worst affected Koyra, Dakope and Khulna districts at least two people
have died and over 5000 people treated for diarrhoea, half in the last 24 hours,
regional medical chief Lutfur Rahman Khan told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is alarming. So far we have more than 5000 people who are sick
with diarrhoea in this region. Another 3000 have been treated for water borne
diseases like dysentery," Khan said.
</P>
<P>
Khan said breached levees and washed away embankments enabled tidal seawater to
inundate the region, destroying almost all sources of fresh drinking water.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis is worsening every day. People are leaving their villages for cities
and towns," he said.
</P>
<P>
In neighbouring Satkhira district doctors have treated over 2000 cases of
diarrhoea since the cyclone hit, again with half the cases reported in the last
24 hours, head of the district medical service Mohammad Ibadullah said.
</P>
<P>
The government said it has dispatched nearly 900 medical teams to tackle the
crisis but charities and local officials warned any improvement would depend on
how soon the authorities can rebuild the destroyed embankments.
</P>
<P>
The army had brought in fresh water supplies but not enough for the cyclone
victims.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday Oxfam's Bangladesh operations chief Heather Blackwell called the
situation "an emerging humanitarian crisis. And it's getting worse every day,"
adding more than one million people had been affected.
</P>
<P>
Some 167 people died in Bangladesh, where hundreds of thousands of homes were
damaged or destroyed, while 70 people were killed in India as a result of the
cyclone.
</P>
<P>
Of those killed in India's West Bengal state, 20 were killed in mudslides caused
by rainfall a day after the storm hit.
</P>
<P>
The low-lying region frequently experiences tropical storms and cyclones during
the monsoon season. In 2007, more than 3,500 people were killed, most of them in
Bangladesh, when Cyclone Sidr lashed the same districts.

Vietnam records first swine flu case: ministry
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HANOI, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vietnam has recorded its first case of swine flu after a man tested positive for
the virus, the health ministry said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first patient of the virus A(H1N1) in Vietnam," ministry spokesman
Nguyen Huy Nga told AFP, adding that the case was "confirmed officially by our
ministry this morning."
</P>
<P>
An initial test at the tropical diseases hospital in southern Ho Chi Minh City
was positive, and two follow-up tests at the city's Pasteur Institute confirmed
the diagnosis, Phan Van Tu, a doctor with the Institute, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The patient, a 23-year-old man, was in a stable condition with a slight fever,
Tu added.
</P>
<P>
State television reported that the patient returned home early last week from
the United States via Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) said it had been formally notified of the
case.
</P>
<P>
It said the patient sought medical attention after noticing flu symptoms a day
after returning from the United States. Five members of his family have been
given medication and placed in isolation, while passengers on the same flight as
the man are being tracked down, the WHO said.
</P>
<P>
Emergence of the virus in Vietnam was "highly likely" given the country's
international travel links, Shelaye Boothey, a WHO spokeswoman, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has been monitoring the health of passengers arriving at its airports in
a bid to detect swine flu.
</P>
<P>
The virus was first detected last month in the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
In its latest update the WHO said 53 countries had reported 15,510 cases of
swine flu, including 99 deaths.

Europe's desperate bid to bring out voters
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
brussels, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
European leaders on Sunday stepped up a desperate battle to persuade people to
vote for the EU parliament this week, but the campaign has opened up new
political divisions across the continent.
</P>
<P>
With polls indicating a record low turnout for the June 4-7 election, French
President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a joint
plea to voters, saying a strong parliament was essential to confront the
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders said they want "a strong Europe that protects" its people and
called for "all Europeans to vote" in the statement, published by the Journal du
Dimanche newspaper in France and Die Welt am Sonntag in Germany.
</P>
<P>
A "strong Europe does not necessarily mean more powers for the European Union,
even more European legislation or even more financial means," said Merkel and
Sarkozy.
</P>
<P>
First steps "to assure real European regulation in the financial sector, based
on coordination and cooperation between regulators" should be taken at the next
EU summit in June, they said.
</P>
<P>
"For speculative funds, tax havens, payment for executives and financial
traders, we want an exemplary Europe," they added.
</P>
<P>
The pair also gave strong backing to the Lisbon reform treaty, intended to
streamline EU decision-making but deadlocked by Ireland's rejection in a
referendum last year.
</P>
<P>
"Europe must play a leading role in the world. For that, it must have efficient
institutions. That is why we need the Lisbon Treaty," they said.
</P>
<P>
Merkel and Sarkozy also reaffirmed opposition to Turkey joining the EU, without
naming the country. "To be able to act, the EU needs frontiers. Unlimited
enlargement is not possible."
</P>
<P>
The joint statement highlighted fears that the vote for the 736 member European
assembly could prove a new embarrassment for the 27-nation European Union, after
a record 45 percent abstention at the last election in 2004.
</P>
<P>
In France, a poll for the Le Parisien newspaper Sunday suggested that 55 percent
of the nation's would not bother going to the polls. In Britain, Poland and
Romania, fewer than one in three plan to vote, according to recent surveys.
</P>
<P>
In Spain, which has benefited enormously from EU development funds, political
analysts expect turnout of 40 percent at best. Portugal expects a record
abstention rate.
</P>
<P>
The stakes are higher now, however, as the European Parliament -- the only
directly elected EU institution -- will have a bigger voice in decisions that
affect 500 million Europeans if the Lisbon treaty comes into force.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of voters don't understand what the European Parliament does," said
Philip White, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform think-
tank in London.
</P>
<P>
"You're not voting to keep a government in office or kick it out. The stakes can
seem a little bit less clear than they are in national elections."
</P>
<P>
But in many countries the EU vote will be a test of the national governments in
power, with far-right and left-wing parties expected to benefit from protest
votes and low turnouts in some member states.
</P>
<P>
In Britain, where euroscepticism runs deep, the governing Labour Party is
expected to garner only 16 to 17 percent of the vote, putting it in third place
against the rival Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, weekend polls in the
Times and Sunday Telegraph suggested.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the main opposition Conservatives, David Cameron, has opened up
new divisions in Europe by saying he would withdraw his party from the main
centre-right bloc in the EU parliament, the European People's Party (EPP), and
join a new eurosceptic alliance with Czech and Polish parties.
</P>
<P>
The EPP is still expected to remain the biggest single party in the parliament,
which already has a key role approving the EU budget and passing laws on a wide
range of issues.
</P>
<P>
The parliament will also endorse the new president of the European Commission
after a nomination is made by the EU summit. Jose Manuel Barroso, the
conservative former Portuguese prime minister, is widely expected to get a
second term.

central Japanese city of Komaki in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to lose. I want to face it with confidence," the 28-year-old,
who briefly played with the Phoenix Suns as a point guard in the 2004-2005
season, told a news conference here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I have no worries at all. I feel it is the time to fight again."
</P>
<P>
The mini-camp is an opportunity for aspiring players to vye for spots in NBA's
summer league in July, another try-out before the clubs announce their final
12-man rosters in November.
</P>
<P>
"I may have to overcome a few things in physical and other aspects but I believe
my speed will be alright," he said, citing the need to work on one-on-one match-
ups and shooting skills.
</P>
<P>
Standing just 173 centimetres (5 feet 8 inches), Tabuse played in four games
with the Suns. He scored seven points against Atlanta in his first NBA game but
his stint at Phoenix ended after about a month when he was waived in December
2004.
</P>
<P>
Tabuse has since played in the NBA development league and elsewhere before
joining the Tochigi Brex in the Japan Basketball League last year.

showed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo's Metropolitan Association on Smoking or Health released its annual survey
on celebrities the public wants to see quit smoking to coincide with the World
Health Organisation's World No Tobacco Day on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Aso was ranked fourth in the survey, collecting 118 votes.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever I see the creased face and hear the hoarse voice, I cannot help
thinking about grim future of Japan," read one comment on the association's
website.

Niger president in 'dangerous' bid to keep power
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
niamey, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Niger president's dismissal of parliament and plans for a referendum to
allow him a third term have sparked deep concern, with the opposition calling it
a coup bid in the uranium-producing nation.
</P>
<P>
Mamadou Tandja, a former colonel elected president in 1999 following a military
coup, on Friday announced he would go ahead with plans for a referendum on a new
constitution.
</P>
<P>
If approved, it would allow him to stay in power after his second five-year term
expires on December 22.
</P>
<P>
His announcement came after the Constitutional Court, the nation's highest, said
Monday it was opposed to the holding of the referendum.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Tandja dissolved parliament, which was reportedly on the verge of
objecting to his plans, before it could make its position known. Tandja, 71, did
not give a date for the referendum.
</P>
<P>
The moves caused alarm at both home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Niger's main opposition group said it sees Tanjda's determination to push ahead
with the referendum despite the refusal of the nation's highest court and the
reluctance of parliament as being tantamount to a coup.
</P>
<P>
"Right from the minute Tandja says he was calling a referendum, he ... loses his
legitimacy as he'll have proclaimed a coup. We will treat him as a mere
putschist," Hassoumi Massaoudou of the Niger Party for Democracy and Socialism
(PNDS) said.
</P>
<P>
Tandja took part in the 1974 coup that toppled the country's first civilian
president, Diori Hamani, and was a pillar of the military regime that governed
Niger until the advent of multi-party politics in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Both the United States and Canada expressed concern about the developments in
the country, which despite being a major uranium producer has also been one of
the world's poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this risks undercutting Niger's hard won social, political, and
economic gains of the past decade, and would be a set-back for democracy, based
on the regular, peaceful transition of political power and faithful adherence to
constitutional due-process," said US State Department spokesman Ian Kelly.
Canadian Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon said in a statement that his country
was following the events "with concern" and "considers that respect for the
integrity of democratic institutions and mechanisms is paramount to a firm
commitment to democracy."
</P>
<P>
One analyst said the president's actions were a reminder of past turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"The history of Niger has shown that once there is political impasse ... the
military tends to intervene," Abubakar Sadiq, a political science professor at
Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria in neighbouring Nigeria, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"This is why what Tandja is doing is very, very dangerous.
</P>
<P>
"Tandja of course belongs to the military class, being a former colonel ... but
that is not a guarantee the military will not strike."
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians from French-speaking countries, meeting in Dakar earlier this
week, also called for the "strict respect" of Niger's constitution.
</P>
<P>
The regional grouping the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
warned that Niger could face sanctions if it forged ahead with the referendum.
</P>
<P>
But Libyan leader and current African Union head Moamer Khadafi, himself in
power for the past four decades, was more understanding of Tandja's position.
</P>
<P>
"If the people decide the president deserves to be re-elected, they can choose
him once, three times or even 10 times," he said at a regional summit Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sadiq said "the world should not keep quiet and allow the rape of democracy
again in Niger."
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Niger Republic is symptomatic of a trend in Africa where
democracy is not well entrenched. Virtually all African leaders don't respect
democratic institutions, they only want to remain in power until they die," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Pressure has to be brought to bear on Tandja by the whole Nigerian nation, the
African Union and the international community to respect the constitution of
Niger Republic."

Israel fumes over US settlement demands
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Jerusalem, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israel refused on Sunday to bow to US calls for a freeze to all settlement
activity in the occupied West Bank, as it fumed over the "unfair" demands that
have raised tensions between the close allies.
</P>
<P>
"I want to say in a crystal clear manner that the current Israeli government
will not accept in any fashion that legal settlement activity be frozen," said
Transport Minister Yisrael Katz, a close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The premier himself did not address the issue at the opening of the weekly
cabinet meeting, but the fighting words were echoed by other members of the
largely right-wing cabinet, including from its most liberal party Labour.
</P>
<P>
A senior Israeli official complained that Washington under President Barack
Obama -- who has vowed to pursue Middle East peace talks as part of a changed
approach to the region -- was placing unfair demands on its close ally.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans have demanded almost nothing from the Palestinians but are asking
Israel to take steps that are a real sacrifice. These demands are unfair," he
told AFP on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians are taking a passive approach. They're not even ready to meet
the Israeli side and Abu Mazen (Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas) wants the
Americans to do all the work," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abbas, who met Obama last week, 10 days after the US president met Netanyahu,
has vowed that that he will not relaunch talks unless Israel freezes settlements
in the occupied West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Obama administration has demanded that Israel stop all its activity in the
settlements, including the so-called natural growth construction that allows for
building to accommodate a growing population.
</P>
<P>
The unusually blunt talk over one of the top stumbling points in the stalled
Middle East peace process has raised alarm bells in Israel that the new US
president could put pressure on the Jewish state as part of his new approach to
the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
"This is an unjustifiable demand that the government and the public do not
accept," Interior Minister Eli Yishai of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party.
</P>
<P>
Social Affairs Minister Isaac Herzog of the centre-left Labour party that is the
most liberal in Netanyahu's government, said that "one has to understand that
there are various statuses within the settlements" and "saying that the picture
is black and white or write or wrong is wrong."
</P>
<P>
More than 280,000 Israelis live in settlements dotted throughout the West Bank,
which Israeli captured in war in 1967. The international community considers all
settlements illegal.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have also complained that Obama's administration has yet to
say it will honour commitments in a letter that then US president George W. Bush
sent to then Israeli premier Ariel Sharon in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Bush said that given the existence of major Israeli settlement blocs in the West
Bank it was "unrealistic" to expect Israel to fully withdraw from the territory
as part of a final peace deal.
</P>
<P>
"This administration has not yet recognised the arrangements made between the
Israeli government and the Bush administration," said Katz. "That can only raise
concerns over future arrangements."
</P>
<P>
Aside from the settlements, there is stark disagreement between Washington and
Israel over the creation of a Palestinian state, with Obama repeatedly saying he
was committed to the principle and Netanyahu thus far refusing to endorse it in
public.

Protester killed in Yemen clashes: medics
</HEADLINE>

SANAA, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One Yemeni protestor was killed and five others wounded on Sunday in clashes
with police who used firearms to break up an anti-government demonstration in
southern Yemen, medical sources said.
</P>
<P>
"One protester, Tufiq al-Jaadi, died while being operated on in hospital. He was
hit by a bullet," medical sources said after the incident in Dali, 180
kilometres (110 miles) north of the southern port of Aden.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said police exchanged fire with demonstrators who carried banners with
slogans against the government, which is controlled by northerners.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration in Dali was on its second day, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Twelve other Yemenis, including four soldiers, have been killed in clashes in
the south since demonstrations broke out late April. The Sanaa government has
blamed the demonstrations on southern separatists.
</P>
<P>
South Yemen was united in 1990 with North Yemen to form the current republic.
</P>
<P>
Socialists who formerly ruled the south led a secession bid in 1994 that sparked
a two-month civil war before the uprising was crushed by northern forces loyal
to veteran President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
</P>
<P>
The president has warned against the risks of Yemen breaking up into "several
entities" amid trouble in the south over the past year, triggered by social
demands and charges of negligence in the impoverished state.

French physicists claim breakthrough in ultra-fast data access
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
French physicists said on Sunday they had used ultra-fast lasers that could
accelerate storage and retrieval of data on hard discs by up to 100,000 times,
pointing the way to a new generation of IT wizardry.
</P>
<P>
The research builds on achievements that earned the 2007 Nobel physics prize for
Albert Fert of France and Peter Gruenberg of Germany, who ushered in a
revolution in miniaturised storage in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Fert and Gruenberg discovered that tiny changes in magnetic fields can yield a
large electric output.
</P>
<P>
These differences in turn cause changes in the current in the readout head that
scans a hard disk to spot the ones and zeroes in which data is stored.
</P>
<P>
That discovery opened the way to "spintronics", a form of electronics that uses
not only electrical charge but also the spin of electrons in individual atoms to
provide a more compact, denser storage on hard drives.
</P>
<P>
But reading and writing data through spintronics has been hampered by the
relative slowness of magnetic sensors.
</P>
<P>
In a study published in the specialist journal Nature Physics, a team led by
Jean-Yves Bigot of the Institute of Materials Physics and Chemistry in
Strasbourg employed a "femtosecond" laser, using ultra-fast bursts of laser
light, to alter electron spin and thus speed up retrieval and storage.
</P>
<P>
"Our method is called the photonics of spin, because it is photons [particles of
light] that modify the state of the electrons' magnetisation" on the storage
surface, Bigot told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Data is retrieved with a burst that lasts just a millionth of a billionth of a
second, said Bigot.
</P>
<P>
Femtosecond lasers currently measure around 30 centimetres (12 inches) by 10
centimetres (four inches) which means they are too big for consumer electronics,
he cautioned.
</P>
<P>
Bigot added, though, that their miniaturisation is likely to be achieved over
the next decade.
</P>
<P>
IBM, Hitachi and other corporations are "extremely interested" by the research,
Bigot said.

First genes spotted for testicular cancer
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists in Britain said Sunday they had found the first genes that are
associated with testicular cancer, the commonest form of cancer for men between
the ages of 15 and 45.
</P>
<P>
Telltale variants in chromosomes 5, 6 and 12 are linked with an increased risk
of the disease, according to their study, which compared the genetic code of 730
men who had testicular cancer with that of healthy men.
</P>
<P>
Inheriting the basket of three factors boosts the risk of the cancer, called
testicular gem cell tumour, by up to fourfold.
</P>
<P>
The study is published online in the journal Nature Genetics.
</P>
<P>
"We have known for some time that men whose father, brothers or sons had
testicular cancer are much more likely to get it themselves and we have been
searching for this genetic link," said one of the investigators, Elizabeth
Rapley of the Institute of Cancer Research, in the southern English county of
Surrey.
</P>
<P>
"We believe there are more (risk factors) still to be found and we are working
on identifying the rest."
</P>
<P>
The three telltales lie near genes that nurture testicular cells which are
precursors in sperm development.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide incidence of testicular cancer is 7.5 cases per 100,000 men, but the
rates vary remarkably between countries and according to ancestry, the ICR said
in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Why this is so is unclear. Inheritance, though, is a well-known risk factor and
seems to be far higher than for other cancer types.
</P>
<P>
Studies have found that the risk to brothers of testicular cancer patients is
eight to 10 times higher than the general population, while for fathers of
patients, the risk is four to six times higher.
</P>
<P>
Testicular cancer is 99 percent curable if caught in its early stages, the ICR
said.

Iran's city of migrants set for intense vote battle
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ISLAMSHAHR, Iran, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With less than two weeks until Iran's presidential election, Islamshahr -- a
city of migrant workers on the outskirts of Tehran -- is gearing up for an
intense election battle.
</P>
<P>
Located southwest of the capital, Islamshahr, a city of 500,000 inhabitants, had
largely voted for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad during the 2005 presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
But four years on, the situation has changed in the city of migrants who have
come from various provinces of Iran to earn a livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Ahmadinejad, who is seeking a second term in office, is still popular in
Islamshahr, but his key challenger in the June 12 poll -- former prime minister
Mir Hossein Mousavi -- is making deep inroads.
</P>
<P>
While the incumbent conservative president appears to be assured of the support
of middle and lower income voters, Mousavi is gaining popularity among the
city's shopkeepers and traders.
</P>
<P>
He was due to address a campaign rally in the city on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"He is a good man. During the war, he handled the situation very well," said
Hamzeh Shirzad, 38, speaking about Mousavi who was Iran's prime minister in the
1980s when Iran fought an eight-year war with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Mousavi is regarded as having steering Iran's economy efficiently during the
war, which erupted when the Islamic revolution that toppled the shah was still
in an infant stage.
</P>
<P>
Shirzad, who owns a fruit and vegetable shop in the centre of Islamshahr, is
clear of his choice for president.
</P>
<P>
A green poster bearing a picture of Mousavi adorns the wall behind him as he
sorts vegetables in a rather empty shop. Green is the colour of Mousavi's
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Large banners and posters of Mousavi have sprung up in the dusty streets of
Islamshahr, where ethnic Turkish-speaking Azeris and Kurds mingle with Persians.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the city -- which saw violent demonstrations in 2000 by
residents protesting against poor living conditions -- has also attracted
numerous young Tehran couples unable to afford high rents in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Pictures of Mousavi, who was Iran's last premier before the post was scrapped in
1989, have been plastered on street lights, stalls and shop windows.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades Mousavi, a moderate, has been in the political
wilderness, but he is now attempting a comeback and has emerged as the main
rival to conservative Ahmadinejad.
</P>
<P>
"The economy is in crisis again and he is the right man to stop it from
worsening," said Shirzad, an ethnic Azeri who has been living in Islamshahr for
more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"Last year I used to earn five million rials (500 dollars) a month. Now I am
losing money," said the fruit and vegetable vendor.
</P>
<P>
"The prices of all food items have doubled. A kilo of watermelon used to cost
3,500 rials (35 cents). It now costs 7,000 rials," he said. "I will definitely
vote for Mousavi."
</P>
<P>
His view is shared by Ali Karimi, a 23-year-old factory worker.
</P>
<P>
"Mousavi is the right choice. Even if the situation remains bad, he can stop it
from worsening."
</P>
<P>
Energy-rich Iran is reeling under an inflation rate of about 25 percent amid the
expansionist policies of Ahmadinejad and Mousavi has vowed to slice inflation to
a single digit if he is elected.
</P>
<P>
Few campaign posters for Ahmadinejad are seen in the streets of Islamshahr, but
the hardline president has substantial support in the city's low-income areas
such as the Tohid neighbourhood.
</P>
<P>
"He is one of us," said Hossein Khorsavi, 63, a retired commerce ministry
employee who moved to Islamshahr three decades ago from his native province of
Gilan in the north.
</P>
<P>
"He has done good work for labourers and retired people," Khorsavi told AFP,
adding that he expected the government to keep its promise and increase his
monthly pension of 4.2 million rials after the election.
</P>
<P>
Mousavi's absence from politics since 1989 is seen as a negative point by
Khorsavi.
</P>
<P>
"We do not know what he did in these 20 years, while Ahmadinejad has done good
for workers. We will vote for him," he said.
</P>
<P>
For Mehdi Mahmoudi, 18, Ahmadinejad is the man of the hour, much due to his
strong anti-Israel tirades.
</P>
<P>
"I like those speeches. He is courageous," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I trust someone who is like us. Ahmadinejad is the man. If there are two people
in trouble, he will first help the one who is in a real bad situation. He helps
the poor."

Slack rebuilding angers battered South Ossetia
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TSKHINVALI, Georgia, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The windows of the houses are still blown-out, rusting armaments are everyday
objects in the streets and the only heating in a bitter winter came from wood-
burning stoves.
</P>
<P>
Residents of Tskhinvali -- the "capital" of Georgia's breakaway region of South
Ossetia battered in the August war between Moscow and Tbilisi -- could be
forgiven for wondering if anything has changed in the last nine months.
</P>
<P>
Russia vowed to plough hundreds of millions of dollars into the region of 50,000
people high in the Caucasus mountains after recognising South Ossetia's
independence. But the legacy of the fighting remains all too apparent.
</P>
<P>
"Half of Tskhinvali is destroyed and nothing has been done. Russia sent money,
but it's up to the government to build things," complained Nadar Sokhrebov, 70.
</P>
<P>
A GRAD rocket still leans propped against the wall of his stone house, gutted in
the fighting. Since August, he has lived squeezed with 10 family members in a
one-room cottage previously used for storage.
</P>
<P>
The sheared-off top of a tank has been left upright in the centre of the rebel
capital Tskhinvali as a monument to the recent war.
</P>
<P>
In the city's old Jewish quarter -- an area rocked by the heaviest fighting
after the Georgian assault on August 8 to restore its control over South Ossetia
-- homes crumpled by rocket fire look as they did last summer.
</P>
<P>
As the region votes Sunday in legislative elections marked by the sidelining of
the opposition to rebel president Eduard Kokoity, questions are mounting over
what the local authorities have done with Moscow's money.
</P>
<P>
"Those who don't have their own means to rebuild are just waiting and waiting
for when the government does something," said Anna Parastayeva, adding her
husband had bought all the materials to patch up their own home.
</P>
<P>
"A fact is a fact -- people lived through the winter as if they were on the
street, with it all leaking into their homes. That is what I saw," she sighed.
</P>
<P>
Only two days ago, some ruined houses were bulldozed in the authorities' first
moves at housing reconstruction, residents said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has budgeted over 10 billion rubles (320 million dollars, 230 million
euros) in postwar reconstruction funds to the region on top of subsidies put
aside before the conflict in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Kokoity acknowledged that there were "specific problems" and the first phase of
the reconstruction did not include private homes. But he insisted that the
process was now on track.
</P>
<P>
"I think that by June 10, South Ossetia will be transformed into one huge
construction site," he said.
</P>
<P>
South Ossetia -- backed by Moscow since it won de-facto autonomy in a first war
in the early 1990s -- more than ever seems a Russian protectorate.
</P>
<P>
Other than Russia, the distant Central American state of Nicaragua is the only
other country to have recognised the rebel region.
</P>
<P>
"True, I can travel to Nicaragua now, but I don't even have a home to go back to
and there's no work there," taxi driver German Zaseyev said sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
Before, residents in this rural region depended on supplies bought in Georgia
and could travel just one hour to Tbilisi for medical help.
</P>
<P>
Now their only outside link is a 120 kilometre (75 mile) drive to Russia over a
winding mountain road often blocked by avalanches throughout the long winter.
</P>
<P>
There is just one factory in South Ossetia that produces building material, a
small asphalt plant, but even it is not often working. Georgia also cut gas
supplies to the region in the wake of the war.
</P>
<P>
After moving between friends' houses for a few weeks at a time all winter,
Gregory Dzassokhov set up a tent in the yard behind his destroyed house on
Khetagurova street for his family this summer.
</P>
<P>
"What are we going to do? Live in the street? They last promised to start
building on June 1, but they have so many houses to rebuild I don't know how
they are going to do it all. Soon I hope," he said.

Donning green vests and yellow gloves, a team of Japanese took the cleanliness
of Paris into their own hands this weekend to sweep up litter around the Eiffel
Tower, the world's most visited landmark.
</P>
<P>
Joined by passers-by of several nationalities, the Green Bird squad -- part of a
volunteer movement in Japanese and European cities -- was aiming to encourage
residents and visitors alike to keep the French capital tidy.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that Paris is particularly dirty, but it's a good way to set an
example and make our cities clean," said Masataka Tanigawa, 25, a Japanese
expatriate who joined Saturday's effort under a cloud-free sky.
</P>
<P>
Like their counterparts in Berlin, Geneva or London, Greenbird volunteers in
Paris descend on a tourist site every month for an hour-long sweep-up. Past
targets have included the Champs-Elysee and Place de le Concorde.
</P>
<P>
"I like doing this," said El Shafey Ayman, 36, an Egyptian who came with his
Japanese friend. "Cleaning up my city makes me feel like a better person. If
everyone did this, it would be very clean."
</P>
<P>
City councillor Francois Dagnaud joined the effort. "The Japanese have emerged
from urban civilisations; they're a bit more advanced than us," he said. "The
cleanest cities are the ones that people don't litter."

Two cases of swine flu in Turkey: ministry

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Turks who travelled to the United States have been diagnosed with swine flu
after returning home, the health ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Both had gone to hospitals with complaints of high fever and muscle pain, and
subsequent tests "established they have been infected with swine flu, or
influenza A(HIN1)," the statement said late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The patients, whose general condition is good, have been isolated and put under
monitoring."
</P>
<P>
One of the patients was hospitalised in Istanbul after returning from  Houston
via Amsterdam on Friday, while the second was under treatment in the western
port city of Izmir after returning from New York the same day.
</P>
<P>
The health ministry asked passengers on the flights the two patients used to
call a hotline and register themselves for a check-up.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, two Iraqi-born US nationals passing from Turkey on their way
from the United States to Iraq were diagnosed with the A(HIN1) virus and treated
in Istanbul for eight days before recovering and being discharged.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old man and his mother were hospitalised after thermal cameras, set
up at Istanbul's Ataturk airport as a precaution against the disease, picked up
that the man was running a high fever. The virus was later also detected in the
woman.
</P>
<P>
The disease has killed nearly a hundred and infected over 15,500 people
worldwide, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, since it
emerged in the United States and Mexico in late April.

Iran defuses bomb in plane toilet
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tehran, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iranian security officials defused a bomb planted on a domestic passenger plane,
officials said on Sunday, the latest incident of violence in the run-up to the
June 12 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The attempted bomb attack occurred on Saturday on a Kish Air flight headed to
Tehran from the oil-rich western city of Ahvaz near the border with Iraq, the
Fars news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Last night, 15 minutes after the plane with 131 passengers took off, flight
security guards found a handmade bomb placed in the lavatory," Fars said. "The
plane landed immediately at Ahvaz airport and the bomb was defused."
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred just two days after a bomb attack on a mosque in
southeastern Iran claimed by a Sunni rebel group killed 25 people, while Ahvaz
itself has witnessed several bouts of unrest in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"Security officials of the Islamic Republic Revolutionary Guards acted well and
the incident caused no casualties," Reza Jafarzadeh, spokesman for Iran's Civil
Aviation Organisation, told the state broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
The passengers were calmed and the plane continued the flight to Tehran, Kish
Air manager Reza Nakhjavani told the ILNA news agency.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a suicide bomber killed 25 worshippers and wounded 125 in a Shiite
mosque in Zahedan, capital of the southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan province
bordering Afghanistan and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
A day later, gunmen on motorbikes fired at an election campaign office of
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Zahedan and wounded two campaign members and a
child.
</P>
<P>
The province, which is home to Iran's Baluch minority who adhere to Sunni Islam,
has been the scene of a deadly insurgency by a Sunni rebel group which is
strongly opposed to the government of predominantly Shiite Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran on Saturday hanged three men in public accused of involvement in Thursday's
mosque bombing, just 48 hours after the attack, which was reported claimed by
the Sunni group Jundullah (Soldiers of God).
</P>
<P>
The mosque attack was reminiscent of a similar outbreak of violence just days
before Iran's last presidential election in 2005 which brought Ahmadinejad to
power.
</P>
<P>
Bombs hit Tehran and Ahvaz, which has a sizable Arab minority, in June 2005,
killing at least eight people and wounding scores more.
</P>
<P>
Ahvaz, the capital of Iran's oil-rich Khuzestan province, which borders Iraq and
the Gulf, was also rocked by ethnic violence in April 2005.
</P>
<P>
Iran in the past has blamed US and British agents in neighbouring Iraq and
Afghanistan for launching attacks on its border provinces with significant
ethnic minority populations.
</P>
<P>
Jalal Sayah, Sistan-Baluchestan's deputy governor, said on Friday that those
arrested over the Zahedan attack were "hired by America and the agents of the
arrogance."
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials usually use the term "global arrogance" to refer to Iran's
arch-foe the United States.
</P>
<P>
But US State Department spokesman Ian Kelly denied Washington was behind the
attack, saying the United States does "not sponsor any form of terrorism in
Iran."
</P>
<P>
Iranian armed forces chief General Hassan Firouzabadi, in comments reported on
Saturday, accused Britain and "Zionists" of involvement in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Sistan-Baluchestan has a substantial Sunni minority and lies on a major
narcotics-smuggling route from Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Wanted Tiananmen dissident enters Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong Kong, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the 21 "most-wanted" Tiananmen Square student protesters has been allowed
to enter Hong Kong, a surprise move ahead of the 20th anniversary of the
crackdown on the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Xiong Yan, who was a leading student protester during the 1989 demonstrations in
Beijing and now lives in exile in the United States, was allowed into Hong Kong
without questioning, he said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I was very surprised as I have tried many, many times to come," said Xiong, who
arrived Saturday night, the first time he had set foot on Chinese soil in 17
years.
</P>
<P>
"I hope in the future I can not only go to Hong Kong, but also to Beijing," he
added.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, he took part in an annual March to mark the military crackdown on the
pro-democracy protests and said he would join the candlelight vigil in the city
this Thursday, which is expected to be attended by tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
The 1989 military crackdown in Beijing followed weeks of protests and left
hundreds, possibly thousands dead across Beijing and led to the imprisonment of
scores of protesters.
</P>
<P>
Xiong, a law graduate, met then-Premier Li Peng during the demonstrations 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
He was placed on a list of 21 most-wanted students in the weeks after the
crackdown and jailed for two years, before being smuggled out of China via Hong
Kong to the United States.
</P>
<P>
He is now a chaplain in the US army and arrived in the city travelling on a US
passport.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, he was also launching a book about his life, including his role in
the protests and his experiences during the Iraq War, where he was posted in
2004, the Sunday Morning Post said.
</P>
<P>
Several other Tiananmen dissidents have been denied entry to Hong Kong in recent
years, although the city operates a separate legal and immigration system from
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Xiong's entry, chairman of the city's Democratic Party, Albert Ho,
told AFP he was surprised and said it was "probably due to an omission" by the
immigration authorities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Danish sculptor who flew to Hong Kong to protest the Tiananmen
crackdown has been refused entry to the city.
</P>
<P>
Jens Galschiot, whose sculpture commemorating those who died in 1989, "Pillar of
Shame," is displayed at Hong Kong University, was stopped by officials Saturday,
an immigration spokesman said.

SKorea, ASEAN to hold summit overshadowed by NKorea threat
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SEOGWIPO, South Korea, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Korea will Monday host one of its biggest-ever diplomatic gatherings,
overshadowed by the growing security threat from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
Seoul planned the ASEAN-Korea Commemorative Summit to promote its "New Asia
Initiative" to strengthen its ties with the continent.
</P>
<P>
But North Korea's relations with its neighbour and the world have worsened
dramatically in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Last week it tested its second nuclear bomb, renounced the truce in force on the
Korean peninsula and threatened attacks on the South.
</P>
<P>
Seoul has heightened vigilance for the June 1-2 meetings with leaders of the
10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations on the southern resort island
of Jeju.
</P>
<P>
"During the summit meetings, our military will escalate its alert and mobilise
additional intelligence assets," Lieutenant General Jang Kwang-Il of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff said last week.
</P>
<P>
Military analysts say any North Korean action would likely be staged well away
from Jeju, but timed to coincide with the summit to cause maximum embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
Security was tight, with a surface-to-air missile unit set up next to the
convention centre, checkpoints on major roads and explosives-sniffing dogs.
</P>
<P>
Yonhap news agency said 5,000 police officers are patrolling the island and
operating high-tech chemical detectors. Patrol boats and destroyers were
stationed near the venue.
</P>
<P>
"We are maintaining watertight security to cope with all possible
contingencies," a senior summit organiser told AFP, declining to link the
measures to any potential North Korean threat.
</P>
<P>
Seoul says North Korea will be a topic at the summit, called to mark the 20th
anniversary of relations between South Korea and ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Leaders will also debate the global financial crisis, climate change and
regional cooperation in trade, economic matters, security and culture.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, especially as we entered the 21st century, Asia has emerged as
a great power economically and in many other aspects," South Korean President
Lee Myung-Bak said recently.
</P>
<P>
"That is why cooperation within the Asian region is important and that is why it
is especially important to improve ties between Korea and ASEAN."
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Asian leaders will discuss the trial of Myanmar's pro-democracy
leader Aung San Suu Kyi on the sidelines of the summit, Thai Prime Minister
Abhisit Vejjajiva said Sunday in a television programme.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN has been reluctant to speak out against its most notorious member Myanmar,
but in May it expressed "grave concern" over the trial and reiterated its demand
for her freedom.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi was charged with violating the terms of her house arrest after
an uninvited American swam to her lakeside home. She has been under various
forms of detention without trial for more than 13 of the past 19 years.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 business leaders from the 11 countries began their own summit Sunday.
Abhisit in a keynote speech said Asia and especially East Asia would emerge
relatively stronger from the global downturn.
</P>
<P>
"In my view, the current crisis will not dampen but hasten the rise of Asia as
the centre of growth and prosperity," the Thai prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea sees ASEAN's almost 600 million people as a market for its export-
dominated economy that can offset the recession in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The resource-poor nation is also eyeing the bloc's abundant raw materials.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN is already South Korea's third-largest trading partner, with two-way trade
worth around 90 billion dollars last year, and its second-largest destination
for overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Korean investment in the region was worth 5.86 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The figures will rise further when the two sides on Tuesday sign an investment
pact, completing negotiations on a free trade agreement which began in 2005.

Thousands march in Hong Kong to mark Tiananmen crackdown
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong Kong, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of protesters marched through Hong Kong on Sunday to commemorate the
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing 20 years ago, including one
of the leaders from Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
Organisers said around 5,000 people rallied through the streets of the city to
mark the anniversary of the military crackdown, which left hundreds, possibly
thousands dead following weeks of protests in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Among the marchers was Xiong Yan, a leading student protester during the 1989
demonstrations who now lives in exile in the United States.
</P>
<P>
He was surprisingly allowed into Hong Kong on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Cheuk-yan, a pro-democracy legislator in Hong Kong and one of the organisers
of the annual march, said it was crucial that the city continued to mark the
events of 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"We are the only place on Chinese soil that can commemorate June 4," he told
AFP.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has become the conscience of China to remember... the crime of the
Tiananmen Square massacre and push the regime (in Beijing) to admit their
mistakes."
</P>
<P>
The attendance at the march was sharply up on last year's figures. An annual
candlelit vigil on Thursday is expected to attract tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
Xiong, who was put on a list of the authorities' 21 "most-wanted" student
protesters after the occupation of Tiananmen was broken up, spent two years in
jail before being smuggled to the US via Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
His entry was unexpected because of China's sensitive attitude to any criticism
of the crackdown. Other 1989 campaigners have been refused entry in the past.
</P>
<P>
"I was very surprised as I have tried many, many times to come," said Xiong, who
arrived Saturday night, the first time he had set foot on Chinese soil in 17
years.
</P>
<P>
"I hope in the future I can not only go to Hong Kong, but also to Beijing," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The marchers gathered in the city's Victoria Park, waving banners with slogans
such as "Pass the torch on, relay the message of democracy to those who come
after us" and "Speak the truth, never forget."
</P>
<P>
The rally included a small group of mainland Chinese students, who wore t-shirts
citing former Communist leader Mao Zedong: "Whoever suppresses student movements
is going to have a bad ending."
</P>
<P>
"I am very excited to see so many people, as this is forbidden on the mainland,"
said one of the students, 20, who did not want to be named.
</P>
<P>
"(It shows) there is hope," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Danish sculptor who flew to Hong Kong to protest the bloody
crackdown was refused entry.
</P>
<P>
Jens Galschiot, whose sculpture commemorating those who died in the 1989
military crackdown, "Pillar of Shame," is displayed at Hong Kong University, was
stopped by officials Saturday and sent back to Zurich, an immigration spokesman
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Albert Ho, chairman of the Democratic Party and a lawyer, said the Dane was
detained for five hours before being put on a flight to Zurich late Saturday. Ho
said he was looking at possible legal action over the decision.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has a different legal system from the mainland, including the right to
protest.

Twelve militants killed in Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HERAT, Afghanistan, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Troops killed 12 Taliban linked to a battle with US troops earlier this month
that caused scores of civilian casualties, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Afghan and US forces raided late Saturday a group of militants said to have
gathered to plan an attack in Afghanistan's southwestern province of Farah, the
deputy provincial governor said.
</P>
<P>
"Afghan soldiers and US Special Forces surrounded them to arrest them. Taliban
fought back but all of the 12, including their commander, were killed," deputy
governor Mohammad Younus Rasoli told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The raid was in the district of Khaki Safed which adjoins Bala Buluk, where
heavy fighting between insurgents and troops in early May led the soldiers to
call in air strikes that killed villagers.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan government said 140 civilians, many of them children, were killed in
the US air strikes. The US military acknowledges 20-30 may have died in the
fighting along with 60-65 Taliban.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Afghan military in western Afghanistan, Basir Khan Ghori,
said the targeted group was involved in the battle in Bala Buluk.
</P>
<P>
The militants had also shot rockets into the town of Farah on May 19 when
President Hamid Karzai had visited to meet victims of the air strikes, he said.
</P>
<P>
There were reports of rockets fired into the town the night before the visit but
they caused no casualties.
</P>
<P>
Government figures for those killed and wounded in the Bala Buluk strikes makes
it one of the deadliest incidents for civilians since international troops
invaded Afghanistan in late 2001 to remove the Taliban for sheltering Al-Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
Rasoli, the deputy governor, said troops would continue operating to secure the
area ahead of August 20 elections.
</P>
<P>
In Bala Buluk, meanwhile, Taliban attacked a police post and killed six
policemen, Abdul Rauf Ahmadi, spokesman for the western police, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Two others were missing and there were also Taliban casualties but authorities
did not have a figure, he said.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan is battling an insurgency led by the Taliban and which officials say
is supported by Islamist fighters from other countries, notably Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The violence has spiralled in the past three years with 2008 the deadliest.

Susan Boyle's dream shatters as she loses British talent show
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unlikely Scottish singing sensation Susan Boyle was dealt a blow Saturday when
she lost out to a troupe of young street dancers in the final of the British
talent show that made her a global star.
</P>
<P>
Despite winning praise from the audience and the judges in her final performance
on live television, Boyle, 48, graciously accepted second place, saying the
"best people won" and wishing the winners "all the best".
</P>
<P>
Boyle enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame over the past two months after video
footage of her audition piece for the show, "I Dreamed A Dream" from the musical
"Les Miserables", was posted on YouTube.
</P>
<P>
It has had about 100 million hits and brought her celebrity fans including
actress Demi Moore and rock star Jon Bon Jovi who embraced the dowdy spinster
from small-town Scotland with a voice worthy of Broadway.
</P>
<P>
Bookmakers made her the favourite to win, but after an unconvincing semi-final
performance there were fears the unemployed church volunteer, who lives alone
with her cat outside Edinburgh, was suffering under the pressure.
</P>
<P>
In a live performance in the "Britain's Got Talent" final Saturday, however,
Boyle proved the critics wrong and repeated her audition piece with gusto.
</P>
<P>
One of the three judges, Piers Morgan, called it the "greatest performance I've
seen on the history of 'Britain's Got Talent' -- you should win the competition,
I loved it."
</P>
<P>
Boyle was up against nine other acts to win the show, which brings with it a
cheque for 100,000 pounds (115,000 euros, 160,000 dollars) and the chance to
perform for Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
More than one million viewers cast their vote following the live performances --
but in the end, Boyle lost out to a multi-ethnic posse of 10 street dancers aged
12 to 25 from London and Essex called Diversity.
</P>
<P>
Following her performance, Boyle -- wearing a grey-blue, long sequined dress --
gushed appreciation for her worldwide fan base.
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank people for all the support they've given me," she said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if it was worth all the media pressure, she replied: "Well worth it!... I
really feel at home on stage, I'm among friends."
</P>
<P>
Boyle put in a shaky performance of "Memory" in the show's semi-finals last
weekend, singing occasionally out of tune and out of time, and some fans on
YouTube questioned whether she could handle the weight of expectations.
</P>
<P>
News media meanwhile reported some erratic behaviour over the past week,
including how she had lost her temper in the foyer of the London hotel where she
was staying.
</P>
<P>
Morgan, a tabloid journalism veteran who forged a friendship with Boyle,
described her in his blog as a "frightened rabbit in headlights" and revealed
she considered quitting the contest.
</P>
<P>
But his fellow judge Amanda Holden said after Saturday's performance: "I have
never heard such powerful confident vocals."
</P>
<P>
Reports on Sunday suggested Boyle could strike it rich if she capitalises on her
global success, with the News of the World saying one of the show's judges,
music promoter Simon Cowell, had big plans for her.
</P>
<P>
"It's the biggest phenomenon I've ever seen out of any of my shows," Cowell -- a
household name in the United States as a judge on "American Idol" -- told the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Asked on television about her plans, Boyle said: "I hope to get an album out --
I'll just play it by ear. What a journey -- unbelievable, and very humbling.
Thank you for everything."

Breakaway South Ossetia votes for parliament
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TSKHINVALI, Georgia, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rebel Georgian region of South Ossetia voted Sunday in polls that could
secure the grip of its separatist leader nine months after it was the subject of
war between Russia and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The local opposition says Eduard Kokoity is seeking to use the legislative
elections to forge a loyal parliamentary majority to push through an amendment
allowing him to run again for office when his second term lapses next year.
</P>
<P>
Russia -- which outraged the West by recognizing South Ossetia as independent in
the wake of August's war with Georgia  --- has said South Ossetia should not
amend the existing term limits in its constitution.
</P>
<P>
Four parties are competing for the 34 seats in the parliament, but the central
election commission has barred the only two parties not loyal to Kokoity.
</P>
<P>
Opposition activities said voting would not make a difference. "I plan to sit at
home. There's nothing we can do," said Alan Gassiyev, an opposition leader,
calling the polls "completely illegal."
</P>
<P>
"It's too bad if he wants to change the constitution," added Grigory Dzassokhov,
a 55-year old former history teacher. "It would be nonsense. What kind of
democracy is that?"
</P>
<P>
Critics accuse Kokoity, an ex-wrestling champion, of muzzling opponents and
stealing the money sent from Russia.
</P>
<P>
As the region scrambles to rebuild itself in the aftermath of the war, the
opposition accuses Kokoity and his circle of diverting lorries carrying
construction material and humanitarian aid to traffic the goods in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Out of over 10 billion rubles (320 million dollars, 230 million euros) in aid
money budgeted by Moscow, South Ossetian authorities say they have spent just
1.5 billion rubles.
</P>
<P>
Kokoity -- who built connections in Moscow working as a trade official for the
rebel region when it was known as a highway for smuggling in the early 1990s --
has rejected accusations against him as Georgian propaganda.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on Sunday, he pledged that the vote would be carried out
strictly in accordance with law, saying the polls were "a maturity test for the
small independent state."
</P>
<P>
"At 10:00 am I can already say there's a very high turnout," he added. Officials
said it already amounted to 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-eight polling stations have been set up for the region's 50,000 residents
as well as additional sites in Russia for expatriates and refugees from the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
Kokoity currently does not have the two-thirds of seats in the parliament to
amend the constitution.
</P>
<P>
And as the looming political scandal in the region threatens to become an
embarrassment for Moscow, there are signs that the Kremlin is scaling back its
support for the South Ossetian leader.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Naryshkin, the head of the Russian presidential administration, said on
Russian television this month that South Ossetia should not amend the existing
term limits in its constitution.
</P>
<P>
Moscow and Tbilisi fought a brief but intense war last August over the region,
which had enjoyed de facto independence since the early 1990s thanks to tacit
Russian support.
</P>
<P>
Following the conflict Russia formally recognised the region as independent, a
move followed only by Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Russia took formal control of guarding its borders this month, in a move
condemned by the West as a violation of an EU-brokered ceasefire that ended the
fighting last August.
</P>
<P>
Some locals said however that they owe everything to Russia.
</P>
<P>
"It's only thanks to Russia that we are here. If Russia didn't help us, we would
not exist in this world, we would be destroyed," said Elena Dzhaviyeva, 72.
</P>
<P>
Voting was expected to end at 8:00 pm (1600 GMT), with the first results
expected two hours later.

Palestinian tensions mount after deadly shoot-out
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NABLUS, West Bank, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tensions between the two main Palestinian factions mounted on Sunday after an
arrest operation for a senior Hamas militant in the West Bank dissolved into a
shoot-out that left six people dead.
</P>
<P>
The Islamist Hamas movement ruling the Gaza Strip warned that with the
operation, which killed one of its senior fighters, the rival Fatah movement
loyal to president Mahmud Abbas had crossed a "red line."
</P>
<P>
The gunfight erupted when police tried to arrest Mohammed al-Samman, the
commander of Hamas's armed wing in northern West Bank who was also on Israel's
wanted list, police and Hamas said.
</P>
<P>
Samman barricaded himself in a house in the town of Qalqiliya in the north of
the Israeli-occupied territory together with Mohammed Yassin, another Hamas
militant and refused to come out, they said.
</P>
<P>
The ensuing shoot-out killed both Hamas men, three Palestinian policemen and a
civilian. A curfew was imposed on the town near the border with Israel following
the incident, police said.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, which has been at odds with the Fatah movement of the Palestinian
Authority president Mahmud Abbas ever since the Islamists seized control of Gaza
in 2007, lashed out over the incident.
</P>
<P>
"Hamas puts the complete responsibility of this ugly crime on Abbas and his
security forces," Hamas said in a statement released in Gaza, adding that Samman
had been wanted by Israel for six years. "This crime is a red line."
</P>
<P>
Describing Abbas and his forces as agents of arch-enemy Israel, Hamas warned it
would respond "with acts," without elaborating. "Hamas will examine its options
concerning this collaborator gang responsible for this crime."
</P>
<P>
Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhum said there was no chance of further reconciliation
talks between the rivals following the "escalation by security services of Abu
Mazen and Fatah against Hamas and its leaders in the West Bank."
</P>
<P>
"Fatah should choose -- dialogue with us or doing the dirty work of the Zionist
enemy," Barhum said.
</P>
<P>
The two factions have been divided since June 2007, when Hamas booted Abbas's
secular Fatah party out of Gaza, leaving him in control only in the occupied
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
They held five rounds of talks under Egyptian mediation in an attempt to
reconcile but to no avail and the two sides have frequently accused their rivals
of campaigns of persecution.
</P>
<P>
The Western-backed Abbas swore in a new Palestinian cabinet on May 20, further
widening the rift.

</P>
<P>
"The patients, whose general condition is good, have been isolated and put under

Recession-hit Croatia votes in local polls
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ZAGREB, May 27, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Croatians cast ballots on Sunday in a second round of local and regional
elections, including to elect a mayor for the capital Zagreb, in voting expected
to be influenced by the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The elections are seen as a test of the country's governing coalition's ability
to handle the effects of the global economic crisis, which sent the Adriatic
country into recession in late 2008.
</P>
<P>
Some four million voters were being asked to elect 221 mayors and municipal
heads.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations opened at 07:00 am (0500 GMT) and were to close twelve hours
later. First results were expected later on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the capital Zagreb, incumbent mayor Milan Bandic of the opposition Social
Democrats (SDP) is being tipped to see off a challenge from independent
candidate Josip Kregar and win a fourth mandate.
</P>
<P>
On May 17, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader's ruling conservative Croatian Democratic
Union (HDZ) was re-elected in most counties in the first round while the SDP
asserted their control in major cities.
</P>
<P>
The HDZ and its coalition partners won seven prefect posts and held a majority
in 14 out of 21 county assemblies. The SDP got four county prefects and secured
control of five county assemblies.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives lost the mayoral post in the country's second biggest town of
Split, on the Adriatic coast, where an SDP candidate is to face an independent.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said the vote confirmed that the SDP and left bloc dominate in
more developed parts of Croatia as well as in cities, while the HDZ and right-
wing parties are more popular in less developed and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The polls give voters the right for the first time to directly elect mayors,
county prefects and municipal heads, along with 21 county assemblies and more
than 550 city and town councils.

Vietnam records first swine flu case: ministry
</HEADLINE>

HANOI, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vietnam has recorded its first case of swine flu after a man tested positive for
the virus, the health ministry said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first patient of the virus A(H1N1) in Vietnam," Nguyen Huy Nga, the
ministry's spokesman, told AFP, adding the case was "confirmed officially by our
ministry this morning."
</P>
<P>
An initial test conducted Saturday at the tropical diseases hospital in southern
Ho Chi Minh City was positive, Phan Van Tu, a doctor with the city's Pasteur
Institute, told AFP earlier.
</P>
<P>
The patient was in a stable condition with a slight fever, Tu added.
</P>
<P>
State television reported that the patient is a 23-year-old student who returned
home early last week from the United States via Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Emergence of the virus in Vietnam was "highly likely" given its international
travel links, Shelaye Boothey, a spokeswoman for the World Health Organization
(WHO), told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"They've had some good detection measures in place," she said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has been monitoring the health of passengers arriving at its airports in
a bid to detect swine flu.
</P>
<P>
Swine flu was first detected last month in the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
In its latest update the WHO said 53 countries have reported 15,510 cases of
swine flu, including 99 deaths.

Once mighty US auto industry faces day of reckoning
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The once mighty US auto industry faces a day of reckoning on Monday with the
looming bankruptcy of General Motors and an expected court ruling on the sale of
Chrysler to a group led by Italy's Fiat.
</P>
<P>
The global economic crisis has hit the US industry hard, prompting massive
intervention by President Barack Obama's administration to prevent total
collapse and a new blow to the nation's economy, which is already in recession.
</P>
<P>
A government rescue plan for GM could put as much as 72.5 percent of the
country's biggest automaker under state ownership.
</P>
<P>
With the hours counting down for GM, company bondholders with slightly more than
50 percent of GM’s 27.2 billion dollars in bond debt voted Saturday in support
of the restructuring plan, The New York Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the bondholders would obtain the rights to buy an extra 15
percent of GM's stock at a low price. They would also control 25 percent of the
new GM, after having supported the new company's creation in bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
Recalcitrant bondholders who opt for confrontation rather than cooperation "will
get nothing or very little," an Obama administration official told reporters
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Government-backed restructuring in bankruptcy court for GM, once the world's
largest automaker, appeared all but certain.
</P>
<P>
Monday marks a deadline imposed by the Obama administration for the company to
submit a viable restructuring plan or file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a US bankruptcy court judge in New York was widely expected to
approve a deal between Chrysler and Fiat on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The third biggest US automaker has declared bankruptcy and is seeking a tie-up
with Fiat in a plan presented as the only way to save the company from
liquidation.
</P>
<P>
Developments at Chrysler could provide an example for restructuring at GM, which
will similarly have to sell some of its brands and close many dealerships.
</P>
<P>
But the administration official said a 60- to 90-day timeframe was "better" for
GM, contrasted with the fast-track process for Chrysler, which filed for
bankruptcy protection on April 30.
</P>
<P>
"This is a much more complicated company than Chrysler, as a global company.
It's three times the size," noted the official.
</P>
<P>
The United Auto Workers (UAW) union said Friday its members ratified a deal to
allow GM to radically cut costs and its debt load, clearing the way for a quick
exit from the expected bankruptcy filing.
</P>
<P>
GM also announced plans to retool an idled US plant to build small cars it had
originally planned to import, and two more US assembly plants could  potentially
be saved.
</P>
<P>
The automaker, which normally shuts downs plants for two weeks during the
summer, is planning longer-than-normal closures at a variety of facilities this
summer, The Detroit Free Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Some factories will be shut down for as long as nine weeks, according to the
newspaper report. This week, about eight out of its 15 assembly plants will be
running.
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy filing could also be sped up by a deal struck Saturday after
marathon talks that saw Canadian parts maker Magna and its Russian backers
taking over GM's Opel.
</P>
<P>
The deal for GM's European operations, brokered by the German government,
amounted to a major development in the remaking of the global auto industry.
</P>
<P>
GM employs some 50,000 people throughout Europe and Magna plans to cut about a
fifth.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose government agreed to stump billions of
euros (dollars) in loan guarantees and emergency loans to keep the ailing Opel
afloat, acknowledged that talks over the future of GM Europe had sometimes been
difficult.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck had even denounced what he called
"scandalous" US negotiating tactics.
</P>
<P>
Yet despite what she called "huge mismanagement" by GM executives, a telephone
call to Obama helped seal the deal, Merkel said.
</P>
<P>
As for Chrysler, a new company could be born within days of approval for
bankruptcy. The Treasury said it had transferred 6.9 billion dollars in public
funds to New Carco, a newly created company to acquire Chrysler's "good assets."
</P>
<P>
If presiding judge Arthur Gonzalez rules against Chrysler, it faces a grim
future, with a worst-case scenario being Fiat abandoning the tie-up and the US
automaker going into liquidation, with massive job losses.
</P>
<P>
Legal appeals were expected if Gonzalez ruled in favor, meaning possible new
delays. Fiat has said it might back out if the transaction is not completed by
June 15.

Sri Lanka seeks help in dismantling Tigers' global network
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Singapore, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sri Lanka appealed Sunday for international support in dismantling the global
political network of the Tamil Tiger rebels after declaring a full military
victory over the separatist movement.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama told a high-level security forum in
Singapore that Colombo needed help in disabling the Tigers' "powerful political
lobbies in certain capitals" that are seeking to resurrect the movement.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for the international community to take all measures to assist
the government of Sri Lanka, to track down the global network of the LTTE,"
Bogollagama said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the forum organised by the International Institute of Strategic
Studies, Bogollagama also rejected allegations of genocide in the last days of
the Sri Lankan military's battle against the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
"This was both fictional and well-fabricated, with ulterior and sinister motives
in order to discredit the armed forces as well as to embarrass the government of
Sri Lanka," he said.
</P>
<P>
There have been allegations that large numbers of civilians had been killed as
the Sri Lankan army closed in on the rebels to end the decades-long war.
</P>
<P>
Rights group Amnesty International on Saturday called for an independent probe
into the number of civilian deaths.
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, The Times of London newspaper had cited what it said were
confidential UN reports stating that more than 20,000 civilians were killed by
Sri Lankan army shelling.
</P>
<P>
But Bogollagama said the campaign to crush the rebels was a model for others to
follow.
</P>
<P>
"Sri Lanka will, no doubt, enter the annals of history as a classic textbook
example of a nation that successfully prevailed over the scourge of terrorism,
whilst tenaciously upholding the cherished values of democracy and human rights
that have been deeply engraved in the psyche of our people," he said.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE's fall would also strike a blow to international terrorism, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The elimination of the LTTE from Sri Lanka as a terror organisation would
prevent other facets of terrorism, such as money laundering, narcotics
trafficking, human smuggling, arms smuggling, and other means of terrorist
networking the world over ..." he said.
</P>
<P>
Bogollagama also emphasised the importance of the immediate post-war actions
taken by the government.
</P>
<P>
"This post-conflict phase is crucial in restoring confidence in people. We know
these chances won't come all the time, and some chances only come once, and this
is one such chance that we have got, and we will not miss out on this
opportunity."
</P>
<P>
He said the rehabilitation and resettlement of the 280,000 refugees displaced by
the conflict was one of the key priorities of the Sri Lankan government,
promising they would be treated fairly.
</P>
<P>
"The government is firmly committed to reaching a political settlement
acceptable to all... We'll have an inclusive process in this regard, and we'll
have everyone who is conscious of our country onboard irrespective whatever
ethnic identity one might have by birth."
</P>
<P>
The LTTE launched a bloody campaign in 1972 to create a Tamil homeland in the
Sinhalese-majority island. Much of its funding came from Tamil communities
overseas.

'Curry bashings' strain Australia-India relations
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MELBOURNE, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Indian students rallied in Melbourne on Sunday as Australia scrambled to contain
outrage over a wave of attacks that has seen it labelled racist and strained
diplomatic relations with New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
What began as a local policing issue in Australia's second largest city has
spiralled into a crisis that prompted talks between Prime Minister Kevin Rudd
and Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh on student safety last week.
</P>
<P>
Students and Indian officials are demanding action after more than 70 assaults
on their peers in a year in Melbourne, including at least four in the past
fortnight, attracting prominent coverage in newspapers here and in India.
</P>
<P>
Pictures from a hospital bed of a comatose Sravan Kumar Theerthala, who was
stabbed with a screwdriver by gatecrashers at a party, were splashed across
front pages in India. A teenager faces charges of attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
"They were saying, 'Don't touch us you Indians' and 'Indians go home' before
they got the screwdriver," said Theerthala's friend, Jayasanka Bagpelli.
</P>
<P>
Another student, Baljinder Singh, told last week how his attackers laughed as he
pleaded with them during a robbery at a Melbourne train station.
</P>
<P>
"I was saying to them, 'I'm giving you all my money, don't kill me, don't kill
me'," said Singh, who was stabbed and left with a six-inch (15-centimetre) wound
to his stomach and has advised Indians to stay away from Australia.
</P>
<P>
Indian media have dubbed the attacks "curry bashings", a term reportedly used by
youths behind the violence in Melbourne's western suburbs, where 30 percent of
assault victims are Indian.
</P>
<P>
It is a grossly disproportionate figure in a city of almost four million with an
Indian student population of less than 50,000.
</P>
<P>
Police deny any racial element to the attacks, arguing Indian students were
often simply in the wrong place at the wrong time as they travelled home late
with items such as mobile phones and MP3 players.
</P>
<P>
But Indian High Commissioner to Australia Sujatha Singh said racism was playing
a part, even if some of the crimes were "opportunistic".
</P>
<P>
Federation of Indian Students president Amit Menghani, who led the rally of more
than 1,000 supporters through central Melbourne Sunday, said the police attitude
had frustrated students.
</P>
<P>
Bagpelli, who attended the rally, added: "It's only because the Indian
government is now applying pressure that they are doing anything."
</P>
<P>
While the attacks are unlikely to result in any permanent damage at a diplomatic
level, Canberra is concerned parents in India may prevent their children
studying in Australia.
</P>
<P>
That would threaten the international education sector here, a 15.5 billion
dollar (12.2 billion US) a year industry that has attracted more than 90,000
Indians nationwide.
</P>
<P>
More broadly, with headlines such as "Australia, land of racism" running in
overseas media, there are also fears Australia's reputation for tolerance is
sustaining long-term damage.
</P>
<P>
"We need to help make sure that the mothers and fathers of all students who come
here are assured that Australia is a safe location to come to, that our general
crime rates and violence rates are very low," Foreign Minister Stephen Smith
told commercial television Sunday.
</P>
<P>
There are already signs the controversy is souring popular attitudes in India
towards Australia, with Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan threatening to snub
the offer of an honorary doctorate from an Australian university.
</P>
<P>
"My conscience is profoundly unsettled at the moment," Bachchan said on his
blog, in which he also reported an "overwhelming" response from the Indian
public over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Theerthala's assault proved the catalyst for widespread anger in India, sparking
a flurry of high-level diplomatic activity and strong public statements from
Indian officials indicating they had run out of patience.
</P>
<P>
"Such attacks cannot be allowed to happen," High Commissioner Singh said.

Two dead in Myanmar pagoda collapse: police

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two people died and four are missing after the collapse of an ancient pagoda
that was recently used for a ceremony led by the wife of Myanmar's junta leader,
police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Police said another 45 people were injured when the Danok pagoda in Dalla
township, just across a river from the main city of Yangon, fell down on
Saturday after two days of heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
"We do not know the cause of the collapse," a police officer said on condition
of anonymity, updating an earlier toll of 30 injured.
</P>
<P>
Authorities using mechanical diggers began clearing the debris from the scene on
Sunday, witnesses said, adding that the pagoda had collapsed without warning.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers from the army, navy, police, fire brigade and local Red Cross all took
part in the operation on Saturday to pull survivors from the wreckage of the
temple.
</P>
<P>
The tiered tower was on May 7 the site of a ceremony involving the wife of the
reclusive top leader of Myanmar's military regime, Senior General Than Shwe.
</P>
<P>
Kyaing Kyaing led the event, hoisting a diamond orb to the top of the pagoda,
situated about 30 kilometres (20 miles) from Yangon.
</P>
<P>
Danok Pagoda, famous in Myanmar because it enshrines two sacred Buddhist relics,
was damaged during Cyclone Nargis in May last year and recently underwent
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, which has been ruled by the military since 1962, is a predominantly
Buddhist nation.

RugbyU: Defence an issue as All Blacks '09 unveiled
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Auckland, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The All Blacks selectors Sunday named a largely predictable squad for their
opening Tests of the year and then delivered a stinging criticism of their
defensive performance in the Super 14.
</P>
<P>
The 26-man squad for two Tests against France and one against Italy next month
includes only three new caps. Veteran fullback Mils Muliaina takes over the
captaincy, replacing the injured Richie McCaw.
</P>
<P>
It was the one bright spot for Muliaina in an otherwise dismal weekend with the
All Blacks named just hours after he led his Waikato Chiefs to an inglorious
17-61 defeat by the Northern Bulls in the Super 14 final.
</P>
<P>
But head coach Graham Henry maintained that game had no bearing on the All
Blacks squad which, with several big names sidelined by injury, was finalised a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
In addition to McCaw, loose forwards Rodney So'oialo and Scott Waldrom, wing
Sitiveni Sivivatu, lock Anthony Boric, scrumhalf Andy Ellis, hooker Corey Flynn
and flyhalf Daniel Carter were also not considered.
</P>
<P>
Two other injured players, scrumhalf Brendon Leonard and lock Ali Williams, have
been selected but are unlikely to be considered for the first Test against
France.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the three new internationals -- prop Wyatt Crockett, lock
Isaac Ross and loose forward Tanerau Latimer -- the selectors have stayed loyal
to players with proven Test experience.
</P>
<P>
The All Blacks will play two Tests against France, on June 13 in Dunedin and
June 20 in Wellington, and a one-off Test against Italy in Christchurch on June
27.
</P>
<P>
"France will again be a difficult challenge for the All Blacks," Henry said.
</P>
<P>
"They have picked their strongest squad available and history shows they are
often successful against the All Blacks.
</P>
<P>
"Italy will bring a different challenge. They will be well coached by the very
experienced South African coach Nick Mallet and will bring a lot of physicality
and scrummaging power to the contest."
</P>
<P>
Following the Italy Test the All Blacks squad will be reassessed for the Tri-
Nations series with Australia and South Africa starting in July.
</P>
<P>
With the first Test less than two weeks away, Henry has little time to work on
areas where he sees a need for improvement.
</P>
<P>
"I thought the defence generally speaking in the Super 14 was not up to
standard," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I've been having a good look at it over the past couple of weeks and been quite
disappointed, quite frankly, at the general level of tackling ability of the top
players."
</P>
<P>
With Dan Carter likely to be out for the international season as he continues to
recover from a ruptured Achilles tendon, Stephen Donald is the only specialist
flyhalf in the squad with scrumhalf Piri Weepu as his back up.
</P>
<P>
Former international flyhalf Luke McAlister, who recently ended his contract
with the English club Sale, has been named in the Junior All Blacks, an
effective B team, and is likely to return to the A side for the Tri Nations.
</P>
<P>
All Blacks squad:
</P>
<P>
Forwards: John Afoa (Auckland Blues), Wyatt Crocket (Canterbury Crusaders),
Andrew Hore (Wellington Hurricanes), Jerome Kaino (Blues), Tanerau Latimer
(Waikato Chiefs), Keven Mealamu (Blues), Liam Messam (Chiefs), Kieran Read
(Crusaders), Isaac Ross (Crusaders), Adam Thompson (Otago Highlanders), Brad
Thorn (Crusaders), Niamia Tialata (Hurricanes), Ali Williams (Blues), Tony
Woodcock (Blues)
</P>
<P>
Backs: Jimmy Cowan (Highlanders), Stephen Donald (Chiefs), Corey Jane
(Hurricanes), Richard Kahui (Chiefs), Brendon Leonard (Chiefs), Mils Muliaina
(captain, Chiefs), Ma'a Nonu (Hurricanes), Joe Rokocoko (Blues), Conrad Smith

Progress in fighting lung cancer at specialist summit

<TEXT>
<P>
Cancer specialists, gathered for an annual meeting, are reporting progress in
the fight against lung cancer, the most common and deadliest form of cancer, but
little progress in treating colorectal cancer.
</P>
<P>
Doctors and researchers at the 45th gathering of the American Society of
Clinical Oncology (ASCO) -- the world's main cancer conference -- on Saturday
learned of two studies showing progress in the battle against lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
The first study showed how the combination of two anti-cancer treatments
following standard chemotherapy can slow the advance of lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
Patients treated with a combination of Tarceva, sold by the Swiss drugmaker
Roche, and Avastin, a drug by Roche's Genentech unit, saw their cancer growth
slow more than a control group treated with Avastin.
</P>
<P>
More than 750 patients were randomized to receive Avastin and a placebo, or
Avastin and Tarceva. Those in the Tarceva group survived an average of 4.8
months before the cancer started growing again, compared to 3.7 months for the
control group, said Vincent Miller, the study's main author.
</P>
<P>
The numbers translated to a 29 percent reduced risk of disease progression for
patients who took a combination of Tarceva and Avastin.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first study to show that adding erlotinib (Tarceva) to maintenance
therapy with bevacizumab (Avastin) delays disease progression in patients who
have already received bevacizumab as part of their initial chemotherapy," said
Miller.
</P>
<P>
A second study with 663 patients with advance lung cancer were given the drug
Alimta, from US pharmaceutical Eli Lilly, which blocks cell growth.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results showed that patients who took the drug lived 26 percent
longer compared to a control group that took a placebo: 13.4 months against 10.6
months.
</P>
<P>
As in the first study, all the patients had already received four standard
chemotherapy sessions.
</P>
<P>
"This study will change the overall standard of care," said Chandra Belani, the
deputy director of the Penn State Cancer Institute, as she presented the
research.
</P>
<P>
"Maintenance therapy with Alimta (permetrexed) offers a new paradigm for
patients who have advanced lung cancer, because it has a low toxicity and can be
given on an ongoing basis over a prolonged period of time to extend patients'
lives," she said.
</P>
<P>
However there were few advances to report in the fight against colorectal
cancer, the fourth most common in the United States and the second deadliest
type of cancer.
</P>
<P>
Research on 2,710 patients with Phase Three colorectal cancer taking the drug
Avastine along with standard chemotherapy treatment showed no difference in the
survival rate or the recurrence of the tumor after three and a half years when
compared to those not taking the drug.
</P>
<P>
Another study conducted in Italy among 747 patients with advanced colorectal
cancer showed that the drug Eloxatine from the French firm Sanofi did not reduce
the size of the tumor when combined with standard treatment used ahead of cancer
surgery.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, several sessions at the ASCO event, scheduled to end on Tuesday, will
focus on the result of clinical tests on female breast and uterus cancer.

After stumble, US Treasury chief reaches out to China
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
washington, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner makes his first trip to Beijing Sunday,
exploiting his early links with China to steer relations with the Asian giant
under President Barack Obama's watch.
</P>
<P>
Having started on the wrong foot by criticizing China for currency manipulation,
Geithner will now have to grapple with issues ranging from key Chinese holdings
of dollar based assets to the global economic turmoil when he meets President Hu
Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao and others during his visit.
</P>
<P>
But analysts are confident that his previous Chinese connections will come a
long way to establishing links with the leadership in Beijing as the Obama
administration banks on China's credit to bankroll the recession-struck US
economy and its growing influence to help ease the global economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
This despite the fact that he lacks the firm business background of his
predecessor, Henry Paulson, reputedly the most well-connected post-war Treasury
Secretary, having travelled extensively to Beijing as a private banker.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, he doesn't quite have the same business background as that of Mr. Paulson
but I think Mr Geithner will turn that to his advantage," said Nicholas Lardy, a
China expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
"I think quite frankly that Mr. Geithner will be a better listener with the
Chinese," he said, citing Paulson's sometimes "very strong advice" to the
Chinese on reforming the financial system.
</P>
<P>
"Now they recognize that what Paulson was advocating did not turn up so well,"
Lardy added.
</P>
<P>
China has not introduced any of the risk-carrying exotic derivative products,
such as the unregulated credit default swap contracts, which are at the center
of the current American financial chaos that erupted during the Bush
administration.
</P>
<P>
Geithner, an ex-governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is a China
hand. He studied and taught Mandarin during his college days and later also
learned Chinese at the influential Peking University in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He also helped former globe trotting US diplomat Henry Kissinger, who was
instrumental in the landmark opening of diplomatic ties with Beijing, write the
China and Japan chapters in one of his books.
</P>
<P>
His father Peter Geithner was also the first representative in Beijing for the
Ford Foundation, possibly the oldest US non-government organization in China.
</P>
<P>
Obama administration officials took pains to emphasize the Treasury chief's
Chinese connections at a media briefing before his departure from Washington
Saturday for his two day Beijing visit beginning Monday.
</P>
<P>
Geithner would deliver a speech at Peking university, his alma mater, during the
trip and "will meet with students and with professors and we hope with some
former professors of his," one official said.
</P>
<P>
He would also visit the offices of the Ford Foundation, which has funded
economics education in the United States of a large group of Chinese who are now
senior officials, academics and members of the economic establishment in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Coincidentally, the Ford Foundation was established by secretary Geithner's
father," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Despite his history with China, Geithner created a stir at his confirmation
hearing in January when he said in a written reply to a senator that Obama
"believes that China is manipulating its currency."
</P>
<P>
It triggered a storm in China and signaled that Obama will take the Chinese head
on over the currency manipulation charges.
</P>
<P>
But Obama administration officials swiftly moved to contain the damage, saying
the reply was written by midlevel staff helping Geithner answer the plethora of
questions from senators.
</P>
<P>
On taking office, Geithner also rapidly reached out to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"I have talked to my counterparts in China over the past few months much more
than I’ve talked to my counterparts from any other country," he told the New
York Times in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing however Geithner faces the tough task of convincing the Chinese to
maintain their massive US bond holdings under threat by burgeoning US debt and
prodding them to make their their currency more flexible.
</P>
<P>
Being the top holder of the bonds, China is the largest creditor to the United
States aside from being the world's largest holder of US dollars as a reserve
currency, at nearly two trillion dollars.

Obama seeks new start with Muslim world
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Barack Obama will journey to the center of Arab-Muslim civilization
this week, to begin the daunting task of draining deep mistrust of the United
States felt across the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
In Egypt on Thursday, Obama will make a personal address to the world's Muslims,
harnessing his own ancestral ties to Islam and globalizing his message of change
in an speech rich in trademark political ambition.
</P>
<P>
Obama's trip next week to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and World War II commemorations in
France and Germany, comes as some observers scent a moment of opportunity amid
the perpetual Middle East crisis.
</P>
<P>
But others see only peril, with a showdown gathering pace between Washington and
Israel over Jewish settlements and no end in sight to Iran's nuclear drive.
</P>
<P>
Obama targeted reconcilation with Islam and rigorous Middle East diplomacy from
his first moments in office.
</P>
<P>
"To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and
mutual respect," Obama said in his inaugural address in January.
</P>
<P>
He quickly called Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas and spoke to the Al-Arabiya
satellite network.
</P>
<P>
Obama made an unprecedented video address to Iranians and reassured Muslims the
United States was not at war with them from the Turkish parliament.
</P>
<P>
This trip's first stop, on Wednesday, will be Saudi Arabia, for talks with King
Abdullah, seeking Arab support for US peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
But the highlight will be the speech at the University of Cairo, co-hosted by
Al-Azhar University, an ancient hub of Islamic scholarship.
</P>
<P>
Obama may try to use the charismatic rhetoric which helped make him president as
a balm for region-wide mistrust of the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I want to use the occasion to deliver a broader message about how the United
States can change for the better its relationship with the Muslim world," Obama
said last week.
</P>
<P>
The speech will also be a promise kept -- way back in the presidential campaign
Obama pledged to speak before a major Islamic forum.
</P>
<P>
In major speeches, Obama embroiders his exotic personal biography into a a
political narrative -- as in his frank 2008 speech about race.
</P>
<P>
In Egypt Obama will reference the Islamic faith of some of his paternal family
in Kenya, time spent in Indonesia as a young boy and contacts with Muslim
communities in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
"The President himself experienced Islam on three continents before he was able
to visit, really, the heart of the Islamic world," said foreign policy advisor
Denis McDonough.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts predict though Obama may fall short.
</P>
<P>
"Expectations in the region have gotten pretty high and I think there is a very
good chance that those expectations will be disappointed," said Flynt Leverett,
a former US official who quit the Bush administration over differences on Middle
East policy.
</P>
<P>
"I think people are looking for this to be the place where is he going to get in
the lead on the Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
"I will be rather surprised if that is what he does."
</P>
<P>
The US image in the Muslim world has been stained by the invasion of Iraq,
stalled Palestinian hopes for statehood and Bush administration aquiesence in
Israel's offensives in Lebanon and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
In 2004, a survey by WorldPublicOpinion.org, based at the University of
Maryland, found just four percent of Egyptians had a favourable opinion of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
A McClatchy/Ipsos poll this month found that only 33 percent of those surveyed
in six Arab countries had a favorable opinion of the United States
</P>
<P>
But Obama's favorable ratings beat those of the United States by 26 points in
Kuwait, 22 points in Jordan, 18 points in the United Arab Emirates, 15 points in
Saudi Arabia, 13 points in Egypt and 11 points in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
That suggests he might be the ideal messenger.
</P>
<P>
Since bursting onto the political scene in 2004, Obama has repeatedly leveraged
his ability to move people with words.
</P>
<P>
But that might be a tough sell in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing Barack Obama could say to Muslims on June 4th that will make
the United States popular, and he shouldn't try," said Jon Alterman, of the
Center of Strategic and International Studies.
</P>
<P>
"The underlying interests are simply not allied with the policies that many
Muslims around the world would like to see the United States pursue."
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to agree to disagree, and that's the first task for the
president -- to frame US policy in a way that takes some of the passion out of
widespread hostility to the United States

Myanmar's Suu Kyi trades barbs with junta over trial
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
YANGON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Myanmar's military regime accused Aung San Suu Kyi Sunday of covering up a visit
to her home by a US man which led to her trial, as the pro-democracy icon hit
back against the "bullying" junta.
</P>
<P>
The claim by the ruling generals is the latest defiant reaction to the storm of
international outrage over the case against the Nobel laureate, who faces up to
five years' jail on charges of breaching her house arrest.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi has proclaimed her innocence at the closed trial being held at
Yangon's notorious Insein Prison, insisting that she only offered "temporary
shelter" to American John Yettaw after he swam to her lakeside house.
</P>
<P>
"It is no doubt that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has committed a cover-up of the truth
by her failure to report an illegal immigrant to the authorities concerned,"
Major General Aye Myint, Myanmar's deputy defence minister, told a security
forum in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"Thus there was no option but to open legal proceedings in accordance with the
law," Aye Myint said. "She permitted him to stay.... She communicated, provided
him food and shelter."
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi, who has spent 13 of the past 19 years in detention, met with
her lawyers at Insein prison on Saturday ahead of final arguments in the case
which are due to be heard on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Her opposition party said Sunday that she was upset that Myanmar authorities had
entered her residential compound without permission to stage a reconstruction of
Yettaw's visit for the purposes of the trial.
</P>
<P>
"Aung San Suu Kyi said she is not completely satisfied as Mr Yettaw and the
authorities went into her compound last week for a demonstration (of how he got
into the property)," party spokesman Nyan Win told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"It was not in accordance with the law. She said it was unjust bullying," added
Nyan Win, who is also part of her legal team.
</P>
<P>
Yettaw, a 53-year-old Mormon and former US military veteran, was arrested on May
6 after swimming to Aung San Suu Kyi's house using a pair of homemade flippers
and spending two nights there.
</P>
<P>
He has told the court that he had had a vision that Aung San Suu Kyi would be
assassinated by "terrorists" and was told by God to warn both the opposition
leader and the Myanmar government.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi said in a statement to the court this week that she could not
be held responsible as the junta had failed to boost security despite her having
reported that Yettaw made a previous visit to the house in November 2008.
</P>
<P>
However Nyan Win quoted the democracy campaigner as saying that she "has no
grudge to Mr Yettaw and his family."
</P>
<P>
International critics accuse Myanmar's military regime of trumping up the
charges in a bid to keep her locked up ahead of elections in 2010, as the latest
six-year period of her house arrest expired on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But in his speech to regional security officials and experts, Myanmar's Aye
Myint said the case against Aung San Suu Kyi was an internal matter.
</P>
<P>
"Countries should refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of Myanmar
that will affect peace and security of the region," said Aye Myint.
</P>
<P>
Ann Taylor, Britain's minister for international defence and security, said at
the meeting earlier Sunday that Aung San Suu Kyi should be released.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar last week hit back at rare criticism from the normally placid fellow
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) over the treatment
of the democracy campaigner.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, whose country holds the rotating
chairmanship of the 10-member bloc, said ASEAN leaders would discuss Myanmar at
a summit in South Korea on June 1-2.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN leaders will meet and discuss an issue that has received international
attention -- about a neighbouring country -- for further cooperation," the Thai
premier said in his weekly television programme.

Troops kill 28 militants in Pakistan tribal area: officials
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PESHAWAR, Pakistan, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pakistani troops killed at least 28 suspected militants on Sunday in fierce
clashes in a restive northwest tribal area and known Taliban bolthole near the
Afghan border, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Battles broke out before dawn in South Waziristan when militants attacked army
checkpoints and other security posts in the towns of Jandola and Spinkai
Raghzai, a security official said.
</P>
<P>
"Forces retaliated and repulsed the attack after a bloody clash," said the
official, who did not want to be named.
</P>
<P>
"Militants were forced to run before dawn leaving behind some of the dead
bodies," he added.
</P>
<P>
Syed Ahmad, a police official in the tribal area, told AFP that at least 28
militants and one soldier were killed in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
"According to my information, 28 coffins were purchased from a local market but
I believe that the number of dead is more," he told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The security official put the death toll at 40 militants and four soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's lawless tribal areas have been beset by violence since Afghanistan's
Taliban regime was toppled by the 2001 US-led invasion, prompting hundreds of
fighters to flood the region.
</P>
<P>
Security forces are currently locked in a fierce offensive against Taliban
militants in three other northwest districts, and there have been reports --
which the army denies -- that the assault may expand to Waziristan.

Climate change: 'Bali Road Map' looks for a compass
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
paris, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gruelling efforts to craft a pact on climate change enter a crucial phase on
Monday when the 192-nation UN forum takes its first look at a draft text for
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The 12-day huddle in the German city of Bonn under the UN Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) means that, after 18 months of swapping visions, the
process will at last get down to the gritty stuff.
</P>
<P>
Little more than six months are left before the "Bali Road Map", launched in
Indonesia in 2006, reaches its supposed destination at a Copenhagen summit: an
accord that will transform global warming from a monster into a manageable
problem.
</P>
<P>
On the table is a small mountain of paper whose notable feature is curly
brackets, denoting discord among scores of submissions.
</P>
<P>
Despite the sprawling range of proposals, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer
said he hoped that the draft will be endorsed as a workable basis for talks over
the coming months.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a negotiating text on the table for the first time," he told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"I hope it will be well received, that it will be seen as a balanced
representation of the different ideas that countries have come with."
</P>
<P>
The big goal is to slash emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050 compared to 1990
levels.
</P>
<P>
But that's where consensus largely ends. Exactly how deep should be the cut be?
How can it be achieved? And who should shoulder the burden?
</P>
<P>
In their proposals, many developing countries say rich countries, which bear
historical responsibility for today's warming, should take the lead by cutting
their emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020.
</P>
<P>
China has led the charge, demanding a cut of "at least" 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
But only the European Union (EU), which has set its own reduction of 20 percent
by 2020, deepened to 30 percent if other advanced economies play ball, is
anywhere near such a figure.
</P>
<P>
After eight long years of vilification, the United States is now being warmly
embraced in the climate arena as Barack Obama bulldozes George W. Bush's
policies.
</P>
<P>
But Washington is also warning that the world cannot expect miracles.
</P>
<P>
A bill put before Congress would cut US emissions by 17 percent by 2020 over
2005 levels using a cap-and-trade system of the kind Bush loathed.
</P>
<P>
This approach would translate to a reduction of only four percent compared to
the 1990 benchmark, but it would also ratchet up to 83 percent by 2050, the top
US climate change negotiator, Todd Stern, said in Paris last week.
</P>
<P>
"We are jumping as high as the political system will tolerate," said Stern,
characterising China's demand of a 40 percent cut by 2020 as "not realistic".
</P>
<P>
Just as unresolved is what the emerging giant countries should do.
</P>
<P>
The draft should at least "call for those wealthier, more capable countries to
take actions," said Stern's deputy, Jonathan Pershing.
</P>
<P>
China is now the world's No. 1 polluter, and Brazil and India have also leapt up
the emission ranks as their economies have grown.
</P>
<P>
Yet all refuse binding emissions targets of the kind that apply only to rich
countries under the Kyoto Protocol, the UNFCCC treaty to be superseded from 2013
by the Copenhagen accord.
</P>
<P>
Then there is how to muster finance to help poor countries adapt to the impacts
of climate change, and how to transfer clean technology so that they avoid
becoming the greenhouse-gas villains of the future.
</P>
<P>
Keya Chatterjee, deputy director of the climate change programme with the World
Wildlife Fund (WWF) said emerging countries were thirsting for the energy
switch.
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of a green arms race where everybody wants to have access to clean-
energy industry," she said. "That's a pretty huge change in the negotiations
that will affect the dynamics."
</P>
<P>
Even so, she said, developing countries were suspicious. "This lack of trust
comes from a long tradition of industrialised countries not living up to their
obligations."
</P>
<P>
These are just a few of the many obstacles besetting the Bali Road Map.
</P>
<P>
The complexity is such that many experts now predict Copenhagen will not be a
complete treaty but, at best, a good deal on the main points.
</P>
<P>
"I think that what we are looking at in Copenhagen is a deal that will lock in
some specific emission reductions goals, will create commitments both for
investment and adaptation and then... the details will have to be filled in
later," said Angela Anderson of the US Climate Action Network (CAN).

US and Russia hold second round of START arms talks
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russian and US negotiators are due to meet in Geneva on Monday for a second
round of talks on renewing a key Cold War-era arms reduction deal, a month
before their leaders hold a landmark summit.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said the three day meeting on the START treaty would be held behind
closed doors at an undisclosed location, mirroring the discretion surrounding
the first round in Moscow nearly two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
"On the details of the negotiation, I think we prefer to keep that in private
right now. I think that's just the best way to conduct these kinds of
negotiations," US State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
First results from the talks are expected to be unveiled by Presidents Barack
Obama and Dmitry Medvedev during their summit meeting in Moscow on July 6 to 8,
a Russian diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Despite a thaw in US-Russian relations following the departure of the Bush
administration, analysts were expecting little concrete progress on the 1991
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which expires on December 5.
</P>
<P>
On top of the complex technical issues surrounding the landmark treaty -- which
took a decade to reach agreement on the deep cuts in US and Soviet nuclear
arsenals after the fall of the Iron Curtain -- the negotiations are also
hampered by differing ambitions.
</P>
<P>
"The sides are not in the same position. Obama needs a result to demonstrate
that the 'reset' of US-Russian relations is getting somewhere," said Evgeny Volk
of the Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Vice President Joseph Biden unveiled the Obama
administration's fresh approach to fractious US relations with the old Cold War
foe, saying it wanted to press the 'reset' button.
</P>
<P>
Disarmament expert Jozef Goldblat said the START talks allowed the United States
to create a climate "propitious for help with other more complicated subjects"
where Washington needs Moscow's support, such as Iran and North Korea's
controversial nuclear programmes.
</P>
<P>
However, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has not concealed Moscow's
desire to broaden the talks to take account of the planned US anti-missile
shield in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The United States has insisted that the defensive shield is meant to counter an
Iranian threat.
</P>
<P>
But Russia regards the shield, which would partly be based in former eastern
bloc countries close to its borders, as a threat to its own security.
</P>
<P>
"The number one stumbling block is the anti missile shield," said Volk. "Moscow
wants Washington to give up deployment but the Americans are against that."
</P>
<P>
Russian military analyst Alexander Goltz said the negotiations also helped
Moscow recover some of its prestige.
</P>
<P>
"The Russians are aiming to make the process last as long as possible, because
the talks restore their status as a world power," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials hailed the "constructive and business-like" atmosphere of the
first round, but US delegation chief Rose Gottemoeller warned before the talks
even began that the process could be more drawn out than expected.
</P>
<P>
Goltz played down expectations for the Obama-Medvedev summit because the two
sides were too far apart.
</P>
<P>
But veteran disarmament observer Goldblat suggested an elegant way out: a five
year extension of START that would give time for negotiations on a "broader"
disarmament deal between the world's biggest nuclear powers.

Major security plan drawn up for Lebanon vote: minister
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beirut, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lebanon will deploy 50,000 police and soldiers to prevent any outbreak of
violence during the June 7 parliamentary election as part of a major security
plan, Interior Minister Ziad Baroud has said.
</P>
<P>
"We will have 30,000 police and soldiers deployed at polling stations and their
vicinity and 20,000 other police and soldiers deployed elsewhere nationwide,"
Baroud told AFP in an interview.
</P>
<P>
He said the plan takes into account sensitive regions where violence could erupt
on election day between members of the current Western-backed ruling majority
and supporters of the Hezbollah-led opposition alliance, which is backed by Iran
and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Sectarian violence between the two sides left around 100 people dead last May
when Hezbollah staged a spectacular takeover of mainly Sunni parts of west
Beirut, prompting fears of a new civil war.
</P>
<P>
Baroud said security measures on election day had taken into account the risk of
violence in each of the 26 electoral districts.
</P>
<P>
"In some districts there is minimal risk and in others it's more serious," he
said. "And it's according to the risk factor that troops will be deployed."
</P>
<P>
For example, he said there was little likelihood of violence erupting in most of
the regions in southern Lebanon where Hezbollah and its allies are assured
victory.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation is expected to be more tense in regions where the vote is
set to be tight, including the southern coastal town of Sidon and in the eastern

Baroud said he was nonetheless optimistic the vote would proceed smoothly,
noting that there had been few security incidents in the run-up to the election.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I am anxious ... but the political situation (locally and
regionally) is more reassuring than alarming," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's up to the country's political factions and every Lebanese man or woman to
ensure there is no outbreak of violence."
</P>
<P>
Baroud, 39, a widely popular minister in the current 30-member national unity
government in which Hezbollah is represented, said measures had also been
adopted to prevent fraud at the 5,200 polling stations.
</P>
<P>
The vote this year for the first time is taking place on a single day rather
than over a month-long period.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken anti-fraud measures including placing transparent boxes in
polling stations, more secrecy of voting and we have adopted international
standards," Baroud said.
</P>
<P>
"Also the indelible ink we will be using will prevent someone from voting
twice."
</P>
<P>
Some 2,200 national observers and 250 international monitors will oversee the
vote including from the European Union, the Carter Center, the Arab League and
several countries.
</P>
<P>
The 128 seats in parliament are divided equally between Christians and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Baroud said he expected final results to be announced on June 8, barring any
major security incidents or fraud.
</P>
<P>
"I am crossing my fingers on a daily basis," he said.

Nearly half Israeli outpost land is private: Peace Now
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Jerusalem, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly half of the land occupied by Israeli settlement outposts in the occupied
West Bank is private Palestinian property, a watchdog group said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Forty-four percent of the land where the wildcat settlements were built belong
to private Palestinian owners, Peace Now said.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of the outposts -- 80 of the more than 100 in the territory --
were either partially or wholly built on private Palestinian land without
authorisation of the owners, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Defence Minister Ehud Barak said recently that he wanted to dismantle the
outposts built on private Palestinian land -- he is going to have lots of work
in the coming weeks and months," Peace Now head Yariv Oppenheimer told army
radio.
</P>
<P>
A senior settler official, Danny Dayan, rejected the report, saying that "not a
single Arab has been harmed" by settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Although the international community considers all Israeli settlements illegal,
Israel makes a distinction between those authorised by the government and so-
called wildcat outposts, set up by zealous settlers without state approval.
</P>
<P>
More than 280,000 people live in Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The
majority moved to the settlements for economic reasons, but an extremely vocal
and often violent minority thinks the Jewish people have a God-given, biblical-
era right to the land.
</P>
<P>
The residents of the outposts tend to be the most radical settlers, establishing
their homes on any land they see fit.

SKorea may scrap steel shipment to NKorea: report

SEOUL, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Korea may cancel a shipment of steel to North Korea for power plant
repairs in protest at its nuclear test, which sparked international
condemnation, a report said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Seoul is considering auctioning off the steel plates, which have been kept at a
state warehouse, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot ship steel plates because of North Korea's nuclear test," an unnamed
foreign ministry official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under a six-nation agreement in February 2007, the North was promised one
million tonnes of heavy fuel oil or equivalent-value aid to repair power
stations, in return for disabling its plutonium-producing nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
But South Korea delayed the shipment of steel under the deal as the disarmament
process broke down.
</P>
<P>
North Korea withdrew from the six-party talks after the United Nations
condemned its April 5 rocket launch and tightened existing sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Council has been discussing a new resolution which could impose new
sanctions to punish the North for its second nuclear test on May 25.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang has further fuelled tensions in the past week by launching six short-
range missiles, renouncing the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953 and
threatening possible attacks on South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe the North is not interested in further disarmament
negotiations unless it is accepted as a nuclear-armed state.

Aung San Suu Kyi 'covered up' truth: Myanmar junta
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Singapore, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Myanmar on Sunday accused opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi of deliberately
covering up the presence of an American man in her home and warned foreign
governments against interfering in the case.
</P>
<P>
"It is no doubt that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has committed a cover-up of the truth
by her failure to report an illegal immigrant to the authorities concerned,"
Major General Aye Myint, Myanmar's deputy defence minister, told a security
forum in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"Thus there was no option but to open legal proceedings in accordance with the
law," he said.
</P>
<P>
"She permitted him to stay.... She communicated, provided him food and shelter."
</P>
<P>
The Nobel laureate is on trial at Yangon's notorious Insein Prison and faces up
to five years in jail on charges of breaching the terms of her house arrest. She
has spent 13 of the past 19 years in detention.
</P>
<P>
John Yettaw, a 53-year-old Mormon and US military veteran, was arrested on May 6
after swimming to Aung San Suu Kyi's house using a pair of homemade flippers and
spending two nights there. He is also on trial.
</P>
<P>
In his speech Sunday to regional security officials and experts, the Myanmar
deputy defence minister said the case against Aung San Suu Kyi was an internal
matter for Myanmar to resolve without foreign intervention.
</P>
<P>
"Countries should refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of Myanmar
that will affect peace and security of the region," said Aye Myint.
</P>
<P>
Critics say Myanmar's military regime trumped up the charges in a bid to keep
her locked up ahead of elections in 2010, as the latest six-year period of her
house arrest expired on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Solving one's internal affairs through its legal system with legal proceedings
in accordance with law does not amount to the threat of peace or breach of
security of the region," Aye Myint said in an apparent reaction to criticism
from other participants at the Singapore forum.
</P>
<P>
"It is the universal legal principle that no one is above the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Only when this legal principle is upheld, put into practice and encouraged will
there be rule of law in a country," he said, adding "anarchy will prevail" if
offenders are not punished.
</P>
<P>
Ann Taylor, Britain's minister for international defence and security, said at
the meeting earlier Sunday that Aung San Suu Kyi should be released.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Burma have suffered for nearly half a century of conflict and
isolation, but Aung San Suu Kyi is not alone," Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
"People all around the world are standing with her and the Burmese people and we
say to the generals: Now is the time for transition to democracy starting with
the release of Aung San Suu Kyi."
</P>
<P>
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates on Saturday also pressed Myanmar's military
rulers to release all political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
"We need to see real change in Burma -- the release of political prisoners,
including Aung San Suu Kyi, and the institution of meaningful dialogue between
the junta and the opposition," Gates told the forum.

Seven Muslim guerrillas killed in Philippines: military
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven Muslim separatist guerrillas died after a foiled attack on a military
outpost in the southern Philippines, a military spokesman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Rebels of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) attacked the military in Datu
Piang town in Mindanao late Saturday in an attempt to destroy artillery at the
base, said Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Ponce.
</P>
<P>
"Seven rebels were killed in the fighting, but there could be more as the MILF
forces retreated with their wounded," said Ponce.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the MILF bombed a bridge and burned houses in Mindanao as part of
what they said were counterattacks against the military.
</P>
<P>
Manila opened peace talks with the 12,000-strong MILF in 2001, but the
negotiations collapsed in August last year after the Supreme Court struck down a
deal that would have given the MILF control over large areas of Mindanao.

Troops hunt Taliban as Pakistan says victory nears
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PESHAWAR, Pakistan, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pakistan's defence secretary said Sunday that a month-long offensive to crush
Taliban fighters in the northwest could end within days, as security forces
hunted down the militant leadership.
</P>
<P>
Swat valley's main town Mingora is back in government hands, the military
announced late Saturday, and Syed Athar Ali told a security forum in Singapore
that three targeted northwest districts were almost clear of Taliban rebels.
</P>
<P>
"Operations in Swat, Buner and adjoining areas have almost met complete
success," the secretary of defence said.
</P>
<P>
"Only five to ten percent job is remaining and hopefully within the next two to
three days these pockets of resistance will be cleared."
</P>
<P>
The army remains locked in battle in some areas, but the fall of Mingora was a
critical milestone in an offensive launched after the Taliban thrust to within
100 kilometres (60 miles) of Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Washington, which is firmly backing the military drive, had warned that the
rebels threatened Pakistan's very existence and identified the country and
neighbouring Afghanistan as central to its 'war on terror'.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to target the top leadership of militants and they are constantly
being followed," chief military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said as he
announced the Mingora win.
</P>
<P>
Officials said lower-ranking leaders had been killed but it was harder to get to
the top leaders, who had a network of hardcore militants around them and had
slipped into the rugged mountain terrain.
</P>
<P>
"They will be eliminated wherever we find them," said one military official, who
did not wish to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media, adding:
"We believe that they are somewhere in the mountains."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has slapped a 600,000-dollar price on the head of firebrand Swat
Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah for masterminding the nearly two-year
uprising in Swat valley to enforce sharia law.
</P>
<P>
The insurgency has transformed a scenic region once popular with Western
tourists for its soaring peaks, pristine ski slopes and cool mountain air into a
battle ground, with armed Taliban in April patrolling the streets of Mingora.
</P>
<P>
Fazlullah led thousands of supporters, a mixture of hardcore ideologues and
disenfranchised young men, in a brutal campaign that beheaded opponents, burned
scores of schools and fought against government troops since November 2007.
</P>
<P>
The government has also offered rewards for 21 rebel chiefs -- wanted dead or
alive -- from Swat and has listed their names and published mugshots.
</P>
<P>
But as the government ups its campaign to stamp out the militants, fears are
growing of a wave of revenge attacks on cities across Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The northwestern capital Peshawar and the eastern cultural centre of Lahore have
both been rocked by deadly explosions in the last five days, killing a total of
39 people and wounding hundreds more.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Pakistan Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud -- who has a five-
million-dollar bounty on his head posted by the United States -- has claimed the
suicide attack Wednesday on a police building in Lahore.
</P>
<P>
Hakimullah Mehsud also warned of more "massive attacks" on government buildings
to revenge the Swat military operation and in protest at Islamabad's ties with
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Baitullah Mehsud commands Tehreek-e-Taliban from the lawless tribal area of
Waziristan on the Afghan border, where militants branded by Washington as the
greatest terror threat to the West are holed up.
</P>
<P>
In South Waziristan on Sunday, military officials said that at least 28
suspected insurgents and one soldier were killed in fierce clashes.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2.4 million people have fled the current offensive in the northwest and
now huddle in refugee camps or with relatives.
</P>
<P>
The military said it had relaxed its strict curfew Sunday in most parts of the
northwest including Mingora to allow people trapped on the roads as they tried
to flee the offensive to return home or leave the region.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people were seen trudging along the main roads out of the region on
foot amid a long, snaking traffic jam, a government official said.

Iran defuses bomb on domestic flight
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tehran, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iranian security officials defused a handmade bomb on board a domestic flight,
officials said on Sunday, the latest violence  the run-up to Iran's presidential
election less than two weeks away.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred on a Kish Air flight headed to Tehran from Ahvaz in the
west of the country near the border with Iraq, the Fars news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Last night, 15 minutes after the plane with 131 passengers took off, flight
security guards found a handmade bomb placed in the lavatory," Fars said. "The
plane landed immediately at Ahvaz airport and the bomb was defused."
</P>
<P>
"Security officials of the Islamic Republic Revolutionary Guards acted well and
the incident caused no casualties," Reza Jafarzadeh, spokesman for Iran's Civil
Aviation Organisation, told the state broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
The passengers were calmed and the plane continued the flight to Tehran, Kish
Air manager Reza Nakhjavani told the ILNA news agency.
</P>
<P>
It was the latest unrest to shake Iran in the run-up to the country's
presidential election on June 12, while Ahvaz itself has witnessed several
deadly incidents in recent years.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a suicide bomber killed 25 worshippers and wounded 125 in a Shiite
mosque in Zahedan in the southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan province bordering
Afghanistan and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The province, which is home to Iran's Baluch minority who adhere to Sunni Islam,
has been the scene of a deadly insurgency by a Sunni rebel group which is
strongly opposed to the government of predominantly Shiite Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran on Saturday hanged three men in public accused of involvement in the mosque
bombing, just 48 hours after the incident.
</P>
<P>
The mosque attack was reminiscent of a similar outbreak of violence just days
before Iran's last presidential election in 2005 which brought Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad to power.
</P>
<P>
Bombs hit Tehran and Ahvaz, which has a sizable Arab minority, in June 2005,
killing at least eight people and wounding scores more.
</P>
<P>
Ahvaz, the capital of Iran's oil-rich Khuzestan province, which borders Iraq and
the Gulf, was also rocked by ethnic violence in April 2005.
</P>
<P>
Iran in the past has blamed US and British agents in neighbouring Iraq and
Afghanistan for launching attacks on border provinces with significant ethnic
minority populations.
</P>
<P>
Jalal Sayah, Sistan-Balustan's deputy governor, said on Friday that those
arrested over the Zahedan attack were "hired by America and the agents of the
arrogance."
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials usually use the term "global arrogance" to refer to Iran's
arch-foe the United States.
</P>
<P>
But US State Department spokesman Ian Kelly denied emphatically that Washington
was behind the attack, saying the US does "not sponsor any form of terrorism in
Iran."
</P>
<P>
The chief of the Iranian armed forces, General Hassan Firouzabadi, in comments
reported on Saturday, accused Britain and "Zionists" of involvement in the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
Ahmadinejad is running for a second four-year term in the June 12 election but
faces challenges from three other candidates.

There will be no transfer fee required to get Nakamura, who turns 31 in late

"It is true they (Espanyol) have approached us," Nakamura's agent Roberto

Nakamura has spent the past seven seasons in Europe, the first three with

Wanted Tiananmen dissident enters Hong Kong: report

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the 21 "most-wanted" Tiananmen Square protesters has been allowed to
enter Hong Kong, a surprise move ahead of the 20th anniversary of the crackdown
on the demonstrations, a report said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Xiong Yan, who was a leading student protester during the 1989 demonstrations in
Beijing and now lives in exile in the United States, was allowed into Hong Kong
without questioning, the Sunday Morning Post reported.
</P>
<P>
"I have not been to China for 17 years and... just feel very happy to be back in
the motherland," said Xiong, who is now a chaplain in the US army, according to
the Post. He arrived in the city on Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Xiong plans to join the annual candlelight vigil in the city this Thursday,
where tens of thousands are expected to mark the military crackdown on pro-
democracy protests, which left hundreds, possibly thousands dead across Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He is also launching a book about his life, including his role in the protests
and his experiences during the Iraq War, where he was posted in 2004, the
English-language paper said.
</P>
<P>
Several other Tiananmen dissidents have been denied entry to Hong Kong in recent
years, although the city operates a separate legal and immigration system from
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Xiong's reported entry, chairman of the city's Democratic Party
Albert Ho, told AFP he was surprised and said it was "probably due to an
omission" by the immigration authorities.
</P>
<P>
Xiong told the Post he would continue his fight for democracy so "people in
China can live with freedom like America one day."
</P>
<P>
Travelling on his US passport, the 45-year-old father-of-two said he was

Swedish pirates have wind in their sails for EU vote
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
stockholm, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Swedish party which wants an Internet filesharing free-for-all, the Pirate
Party, could become one of the surprise new entrants to the European parliament
this week.
</P>
<P>
The party, which also wants to beef up Internet privacy, was founded in January
2006 and quickly attracted members angered by controversial laws adopted in the
Scandinavian country that criminalised filesharing and authorised monitoring of
emails.
</P>
<P>
Its membership shot up after a Stockholm court on April 17 sentenced four Swedes
to a year in jail for running one of the world's biggest filesharing sites, The
Pirate Bay.
</P>
<P>
"When the verdict was announced at 11:00 am, we had 14,711 members," Rick
Falkvinge, the 37-year-old founder of the party, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"We tripled in a week, becoming the third-biggest party in Sweden in terms of
numbers. All of a sudden we were everywhere."
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls ahead of the June 7 European parliament elections credit the party
with between 5.5 and 7.9 percent of votes, well above the four percent required
to win a seat.
</P>
<P>
In the 2006 general election, held eight months after it's creation, the Pirate
Party won just 0.6 percent of votes.
</P>
<P>
"They have been very lucky because The Pirate Bay verdict came at the same time
as the start of the election campaign, but I think The Pirate Party had the
potential to grow anyway," a political scientist at Gothenburg University, Ulf
Bjereld, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"The Pirate Party has taken advantage of a new cleavage in Swedish politics,
about civil liberties, about who should have the right to decide over knowledge,
and that's not a left-right cleavage," Bjereld said.
</P>
<P>
"The traditional parties have been sleeping, they have underestimated the
political potential in these issues," he added.
</P>
<P>
The European parliament election, with little at stake in Sweden and a low
turnout expected, is considered the perfect opportunity for an election
sensation, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
"People tend to think there are very few differences between the parties in the
EU elections. If you could have a (unique) profile there, it's easier to
succeed," said Toivo Sjoeren, head of the Sifo polling institute.
</P>
<P>
The typical Pirate Party supporter is a young, male Internet buff.
</P>
<P>
According to Sifo, some 13 percent of people under 30 plan to vote for the
party, compared to seven percent of those aged 30 to 49, and only three percent
of those over the age of 49.
</P>
<P>
The party garners some 10.5 percent support among male voters, but only 1.5
percent of women.
</P>
<P>
"It's a 'geek' party," admitted Brian Levinsen, a 31-year-old member, attending
a recent campaign meeting in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
"We use Twitter, Skype, we use blogs," explained Jan Lindgren, the party's
campaign director in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
"There is always someone (from the party) online, even at 2:00 or 4:00 in the
morning," he added.
</P>
<P>
Many members say they joined not only because they are die-hard fans of the
Internet and filesharing, but because they fear a "Big Brother" society.
</P>
<P>
"Sweden was built on protecting the freedom of its citizens. This pact is now
disappearing," said Levinsen.
</P>
<P>
"They want to impose controls on what we're saying, like in China or in North
Korea. We're not there yet, but we're on the way," said Robert Nyberg, a 29
-year-old demolition worker clad in a purple tee-shirt bearing the party's black
flag.
</P>
<P>
The Pirate Party, which has sister parties in 20 countries, is also standing in
the European elections in Poland and Germany.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 375 million voters across the 27 nation bloc will elect 736
deputies for a five-year term at the parliament, which has an important role
passing pan-European legislation and the EU commission's annual budget.

Sarkozy exiles glamorous Dati
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PARIS, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The outfits are still elegant, the heels still vertiginous, but Rachida Dati's
flashing smile seems just a little more forced since she found out she was being
exiled to the European parliament.
</P>
<P>
For the 42-year-old Dati, a virtually guaranteed victory in the EU election is
seen as proof of the justice minister's dramatic fall from President Nicolas
Sarkozy's good graces.
</P>
<P>
Once her seat in the EU parliament is confirmed after France's vote on June 7,
Dati, the first French minister from North African immigrant stock, will have to
resign from Sarkozy's government.
</P>
<P>
"I had the immense honour of being the justice minister, so I'm not going to be
bitter about it," Dati said in a television interview, warning: "They won't get
rid of me like that!"
</P>
<P>
Having risen to power as Sarkozy's devoted aide, she will now have to launch
into electoral politics away from her natural habitat in the glittering salons
of the Parisian elite.
</P>
<P>
Mocked by opponents as a lightweight, Dati was all steel and seriousness at a
recent electoral meeting in a well-heeled western Paris suburb.
</P>
<P>
She replied with poise to questions from the crowd, many drawn to the event more
by her celebrity status and reputation for gaffes than by enthusiasm for the
European parliament election.
</P>
<P>
"Rachida Dati lacks neither skill nor determination," said analyst Philippe
Braud. "She can bounce back. She has political trump cards: she represents
ethnic diversity, she's a fighter and she fascinates the media."
</P>
<P>
Dati, a lawyer by training who became an advisor and spokeswoman for Sarkozy,
was an outsider without political experience when he made her justice minister
after his 2007 election triumph.
</P>
<P>
Dati, with her rags to riches background, and other surprise female picks added
energy to the line up, and Sarkozy was visibly proud of her.
</P>
<P>
She threw herself into an ambitious programme to reform the French legal system,
closely following promises made by the president, but antagonised a generation
of magistrates and ministerial aides with her domineering style.
</P>
<P>
A close friend of Sarkozy's second wife, Cecilia, she became a regular feature
in celebrity magazines and gossip columns, gaining a reputation for her couture
outfits and jet set parties.
</P>
<P>
Eyebrows were also raised when the government was forced to confirm that the
justice ministry had overspent its 200,000-euro (272,000-dollar) annual
entertainment budget after she hosted several luxury receptions.
</P>
<P>
Concerned that his protegee needed a power base of her own, Sarkozy had her
parachuted into Paris' 7th district as mayor, and began to push for her to take
on a more party political role.
</P>
<P>
But Dati's star slipped as magistrates demonstrated against her bid to
streamline the court system and jail wardens against conditions said to have
contributed to a spate of prison suicides.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other changes were afoot. Nicolas and Cecilia Sarkozy divorced and
Dati has never been as close to his third wife, former super model Carla Bruni.
</P>
<P>
Dati's private life is also, in her own term, "complicated". In January, she
gave birth to a daughter, Zohra. Her refusal to name the child's father has
triggered a whirl of media speculation about his identity.
</P>
<P>
She rushed back to work five days later, earning praise from some quarters as a
role model for career women, but brickbats from those who thought her haste
undermined the fight for generous maternity leave.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, despite Dati's display of unruffled commitment to his cause,
Sarkozy took personal charge of the judicial reform agenda, in an early sign
that he was tiring of his former ally.
</P>
<P>
Rather than sack her and call into question his own judgment in picking her,
Sarkozy set about strong-arming her into the European campaign, which she had
previously said she had no interest in.
</P>
<P>
The race began badly when a video of her giggling inanely and failing to answer
questions on European policy at a youth event made the rounds of the Internet.
She has since showed more determination and ambition in the campaign.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The European Union parliament has long had the image of being a gravy-train but
an EU election is no picnic.
</P>
<P>
The voting system is as arcane as the 27-nation EU is widespread. The election
for the 736 lawmakers takes four days and there will be weeks of bargaining
afterwards to settle the assembly's top jobs.
</P>
<P>
Voting starts on Thursday in Britain and the Netherlands. Ireland holds its
election on the following day, the Czech Republic on June 5 and 6, and Slovakia
Latvia, Malta and Cyprus vote on June 6.
</P>
<P>
France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the other 15 countries in the EU all hold
their elections on the Sunday. The first reliable forecasts will come out about
2000 GMT on the night of June 7.
</P>
<P>
Each country uses its own preferred voting system.
</P>
<P>
While any EU citizen can stand as a candidate or vote in any EU country where he
or she is resident and registered on the electoral list, rules such as the
minimum age for voting changes from country to country.
</P>
<P>
There were 785 deputies in the old assembly. The Treaty of Nice ordered the
cutback but this could be only temporary. If the Treaty of Lisbon is ever
ratified by every member the number will go up again to 754.
</P>
<P>
Each country's representation is roughly in line with its population. Malta, the
smallest member, has five deputies. Germany, the biggest, has 99. The other main
powers -- Britain, France and Italy -- have 72 each, while Poland and Spain
elect 50 each.
</P>
<P>
One of the big unknowns is how the extra 18 deputies will be shared out, if the
Lisbon reform treaty comes into force.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the new assembly will be on July 14-16 in Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
It will have to elect a new parliament president to take charge of the assembly
for the first half of its five year term.
</P>
<P>
As the centre-right bloc is expected to gain the upper hand in the election,
their candidates, former Polish prime minister Jerzy Buzek, and Italian Euro
deputy Mario Mauro, a close ally of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi,
are favourites.
</P>
<P>
One of their first duties will also be to approve the European Commission
president nominated by an EU summit at the end of June. Jose Manuel Barroso, the
former Portuguese prime minister, is widely expected to get a second term.

Europe's desperate bid to bring out voters
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
brussels, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
European leaders on Sunday stepped up a desperate battle to persuade people to
vote for the unloved EU parliament this week, but the campaign has opened up new
political divisions across the continent.
</P>
<P>
With polls indicating a record low turnout for the June 4-7 election, French
President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a joint
plea to voters, saying a strong parliament was essential to confront the
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two said they want "a strong Europe that protects" its people and called for
"all Europeans to vote" in the statement, published by the Journal du Dimanche
newspaper in France and Die Welt am Sonntag in Germany.
</P>
<P>
A "strong Europe does not necessarily mean more powers for the European Union,
even more European legislation or even more financial means," said Merkel and
Sarkozy who still called for "real European regulation" to tackle the financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
They said first steps "to assure real European regulation in the financial
sector, based on coordination and cooperation between regulators" should be
taken at the EU summit in June.
</P>
<P>
"For speculative funds, tax havens, payment for executives and financial
traders, we want an exemplary Europe," the French and German leaders said.
</P>
<P>
The pair also gave strong backing to the Lisbon reform treaty, deadlocked by
Ireland's rejection in a referendum last year.
</P>
<P>
"Europe must play a leading role in the world. For that, it must have efficient
institutions. That is why we need the Lisbon Treaty," they said.
</P>
<P>
Merkel and Sarkozy said they were ready to work on "political accord on
guarantees for Ireland" at the June summit and they have "confidence in the
Irish to choose Europe" when they hold a new referendum this year.
</P>
<P>
The two also reaffirmed opposition to Turkey joining the EU, without naming the
country. "To be able to act, the EU needs frontiers. Unlimited enlargement is
not possible."
</P>
<P>
The statement highlighted fears that the vote for the 736 member European
assembly could prove a new embarrassment for the 27-nation EU.
</P>
<P>
There was a record 45 percent abstention at the last election in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Surveys in France indicate that only a third of the electorate will take part in
the country's EU vote next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In Britain, Poland and Romania, fewer than one in three people plan to vote,
according to recent surveys.
</P>
<P>
In Spain, which has benefited enormously from EU funds, analysts expect turnout
of 40 percent at best. Portugal expects a record abstention rate.
</P>
<P>
The stakes are higher now however as the parliament is likely to win a bigger
voice in decisions that affect the EU's 500 million population if the Lisbon
treaty comes into force.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of voters don't understand what the European Parliament does," said
Philip White, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform in
London.
</P>
<P>
"You're not voting to keep a government in office or kick it out. The stakes can
seem a little bit less clear than they are in national elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
But in many countries the EU vote will be a test of the national governments in
power. Far right and left wing parties are expected to benefit from protest
votes in some countries.
</P>
<P>
Polls indicate Britain's ruling Labour Party will be hammered in the election,
which will be held on Thursday, possibly dropping into third place.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the main opposition Conservative Party, David Cameron, has opened
up new divisions in Europe by saying he would withdraw his party from the main
centre-right bloc in the EU parliament, the European People's Party (EPP), and
join a new more euro-sceptic alliance with parties from the Czech Republic and
Poland.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt's conservative Moderates are also
losing ground in the run-up to the elections, according to opinion poll released
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The EPP is still expected to remain the biggest single party in the parliament,
which already has a key role approving the EU budget and passing laws on a wide
range of issues.
</P>
<P>
The parliament will also endorse the new president of the European Commission
after a nomination is made by the EU summit. Jose Manuel Barroso, the
conservative former Portuguese prime minister, is widely expected to get a
second term.

SKorean carmaker Ssangyong closes strike-hit plant
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SEOUL, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Korea's smallest automaker Ssangyong Motor said Sunday that it had
temporarily shut its main factory, which has been occupied by workers striking
over massive planned job cuts.
</P>
<P>
"The closure was inevitable because of mounting losses, which have endangered
our survival," the company said in a statement, adding it would ask police to
evict the workers from the plant in Pyeongtaek, south of Seoul.
</P>
<P>
The work stoppage began on May 21 after the company announced plans to sack
2,646 employees -- 36 percent of its workforce -- in what would be the country's
first mass layoffs since the onset of the global economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Workers occupying the factory are demanding managers minimise job losses through
work-sharing.
</P>
<P>
The debt-stricken company in February won court protection from creditors.  The
court told its Chinese majority owner, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp (SAIC),
to give up management control.
</P>
<P>
Court-appointed managers have since struggled to turn the company around through
job cuts and cost savings.
</P>
<P>
Ssangyong specialises in sports-utility vehicles and luxury sedans.

Southeast Asian nations to talk on Myanmar: Thai PM

<TEXT>
<P>
Southeast Asian leaders will discuss Myanmar's trial of opposition leader Aung
San Suu Kyi on the sidelines of a summit in South Korea next week, Thai Prime
Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) earlier this month issued a
rare rebuke against military-ruled Myanmar, its most troublesome member, for the
regime's treatment of the Nobel Laureate.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi, 63, faces up to five years in jail on charges of breaching the
terms of her house arrest after an incident in which an American swam to her
lakeside house.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN leaders will meet and discuss an issue that has received international
attention -- about a neighbouring country -- for further cooperation," the Thai
premier said in his weekly television programme.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN-Korea Commemorative Summit takes place on June 1-2 in the southern
resort island of Jeju, overshadowed by the growing security threat from North
Korea and the issue of Aung San Suu Kyi.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, which holds the rotating chairmanship of ASEAN, issued a statement on
May 18 expressing "grave concern" about Aung San Suu Kyi and saying that the
"honour and the credibility" of Myanmar's government were at stake.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's ruling junta hit back a week later, saying that it "strongly rejected"
the statement and accusing Thailand of meddling in its internal affairs.

Israel rescue services begin 'doomsday' drill
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Jerusalem, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israel began its largest-ever national exercise on Sunday to test the response
of emergency services to potential missile attacks, bombings and natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
The five-day exercise will simulate simultaneous rocket strikes from the Gaza
Strip and Lebanon and missile attacks from arch-foes Syria and Iran and test the
way rescue services deal with the attacks.
</P>
<P>
"We will be exercising the doomsday scenario of simultaneous strikes against
Israel on all fronts and by different means," defence ministry spokesman Shlomo
Dror told AFP last week.
</P>
<P>
This will include conventional, chemical and biological strikes against large
population centres. It will also simulate a wave of Palestinian suicide
bombings.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, when air-raid sirens sound across the country and citizens must
scramble to shelters, in some areas within seconds and others within no more
than three minutes.
</P>
<P>
Exercise Turning Point 3 will also simulate the conduct of rescue and medical
services during earthquakes and epidemics.
</P>
<P>
And there will be simulated cabinet meetings in which ministers will weigh their
response to such attacks and scenarios.
</P>
<P>
It is the third consecutive year Israel is conducting such an exercise, although
this year's drill is the largest-ever.
</P>
<P>
The manoeuvres began in the aftermath of the July-August 2006 war with Lebanon's
Hezbollah militia, which revealed major weaknesses in how the Jewish state's
homefront dealt with the rocket attacks.
</P>
<P>
"The Second Lebanon War revealed that the homefront was not well prepared for
war and citizens found it hard to adapt to the special situation," Dror said.
</P>
<P>
The drill comes just two weeks after the air force wrapped up a massive four-day
exercise that tested its ability to defend against missile and jet strikes from
Syria and Iran.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the army has simulated strikes from the Islamic republic,
located more than 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) away, he said.

Yassin and another Hamas militant were killed along with three policemen and a

Israel will not agree to US demands to freeze all settlement activity in the
occupied West Bank, a minister close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I want to say in a crystal clear manner that the current Israeli government
will not accept in any fashion that legal settlement activity in Judea and
Samaria be frozen," said Transport Minister Yisrael Katz, using the Israeli term
for the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"The government will defend the vital interests of the state of Israel," he told
army radio.
</P>
<P>
It was the first high-level reaction to a call by President Barack Obama on
Thursday during a meeting with Palestinian counterpart Mahmud Abbas that Israel
stop settlement activity, a key obstacle in the hobbled Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Although the international community considers all Israeli settlements illegal,
Israel makes a distinction between those the government authorised and so-called
wildcat outposts, set up by zealous settlers without state approval.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said his government would dismantle the outposts, but has argued
that expansion of existing blocks should be allowed to continue.

Pakistan hunts Taliban leadership after Swat gain
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Peshawar, Pakistan, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pakistan on Sunday pursued the Taliban leadership in the northwest after seizing
the main town in Swat valley from the militants, as it continues its drive to
flush out extremists.
</P>
<P>
The business and administrative hub of Mingora was back in government hands,
military officials announced late Saturday, more than a month after Islamabad
began its blistering assault against advancing Taliban insurgents.
</P>
<P>
The army is still fighting Taliban guerrillas, but the fall of Mingora is a
critical milestone in an offensive across three northwest districts launched
after the Taliban thrust to within 100 kilometres (60 miles) of Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Washington, which is firmly backing the military drive, had warned the rebels
threatened Pakistan's very existence and identified the country and neighbouring
Afghanistan as central to its 'war on terror'.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to target the top leadership of militants and they are constantly
being followed," chief military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said as he
announced the Mingora win.
</P>
<P>
Officials said lower-ranking leaders had been killed but it was harder to get to
the top leaders, who had a network of hardcore militants around them.
</P>
<P>
"They will be eliminated wherever we find them," said one military official, who
did not wish to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media, adding
that: "We believe that they are somewhere in the mountains."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has slapped a 600,000-dollar price on the head of firebrand Swat
Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah for masterminding the nearly two-year
uprising in Swat valley to enforce sharia law.
</P>
<P>
The insurgency has transformed a scenic region once popular with Western
tourists for its soaring peaks, pristine ski slopes and cool mountain air into a
battle ground, with armed Taliban in April patrolling the streets of Mingora.
</P>
<P>
Fazlullah led thousands of supporters, a mixture of hardcore ideologues and
disenfranchised young men, in a brutal campaign that beheaded opponents, burned
scores of schools and fought against government troops since November 2007.
</P>
<P>
The government has also offered rewards for 21 rebel chiefs -- dead or alive --
from Swat, and on Thursday listed names and published mugshots.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's northwestern capital Peshawar and the eastern cultural centre of
Lahore have both been rocked by deadly explosions in the last five days, as
fears grow that the Taliban is exacting revenge for the offensive.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Pakistan Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud -- who has a five-
million-dollar bounty on his head posted by the United States -- had on Thursday
claimed the suicide attack on a police building in Lahore.
</P>
<P>
Hakimullah Mehsud also warned of more "massive attacks" on government buildings
to revenge the Swat military operation and in protest at Islamabad's close ties
with Washington.
</P>
<P>
Baitullah Mehsud commands Tehreek-e-Taliban from the lawless tribal area of
Waziristan on the Afghan border in the rugged mountains, where militants branded
by Washington as the greatest terror threat to the West are holed up.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2.4 million people have fled the fighting in the northwest and now huddle
in refugee camps or with relatives, and as the crisis drags on analysts warn
that public opinion against the offensive may sour.
</P>
<P>
The military said it had relaxed its strict curfew Sunday in most parts of the
northwest including Mingora to allow people trapped on the roads as they tried
to flee the offensive to return home or leave the region.
</P>
<P>
"The curfew will be relaxed from 6:00 am to 1:00 pm in Swat and Malakand," a
statement issued by the military said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people were seen trudging along the main roads out of the region on
foot amid a long, snaking traffic jam, a government official said.

Iran defuses bomb on board domestic flight: Fars agency
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tehran, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iranian security officials have defused a handmade bomb on board a domestic
flight headed from Ahvaz, in the west of Iran, to the capital Tehran, Fars news
agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Last night, 15 minutes after the plane with 131 passengers took off, flight
security guards found a handmade bomb placed in the lavatory," Fars said. "The
plane landed immediately in Ahvaz airport and the bomb was defused."
</P>
<P>
It said the Kish Air flight had taken off at 10:20 pm (1750 GMT) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ahvaz is the capital of Iran's oil-rich Khuzestan province, which borders Iraq
and the Gulf. Sunday's incident occurred as Iran prepares for presidential
elections on June 12.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday a suicide bomber killed 25 and wounded 125 worshippers in a Shiite
mosque in Zahedan in southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan province bordering
Afghanistan and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The province, which is home to Iran's Baluch minority who adhere to Sunni Islam,
has been the scene of a deadly insurgency by a Sunni rebel group which is
strongly opposed to the government of predominantly Shiite Iran.
</P>
<P>
The attack on the mosque was reminiscent of a similar outbreak of violence just
days before Iran's last presidential election in 2005 which brought Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad to power.
</P>
<P>
Bombs hit Tehran and Ahvaz, which has a sizable Arab minority, in June 2005,
killing at least eight people and wounding scores more.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 kilometres (320 miles) southeast of Tehran and 50 kilometres from the
Iraqi border, Ahvaz was also rocked by ethnic violence in April 2005.
</P>
<P>
Iran in the past has blamed US and British agents in neighbouring Iraq and
Afghanistan for launching attacks on border provinces with significant ethnic
minority populations.

India superstar Bachchan snubs Australia over student attacks
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New Delhi, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan has  rejected an honorary doctorate from a
Brisbane university to protest against a wave of attacks on Indian students in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
"Under the prevailing circumstances I find it inappropriate at this juncture to
accept this decoration," Bachchan said in a letter to the Queensland University
of Technology posted on his blog Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"My conscience is profoundly unsettled at the moment," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Bachchan, 66, known as "The Big B" in movie-mad India, had used his blog to
request fan feedback on whether he should accept the degree -- awarded for his
contribution to the world of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
He said he had been "overwhelmed" by the response.
</P>
<P>
A series of attacks on Indian students has unleashed a furious reaction in India
and strained diplomatic ties with Australia.
</P>
<P>
Australian police have rejected claims that the attacks were racially motivated,
saying the students were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
India has said it is "closely monitoring" the situation, while Australia's High
Commissioner in New Delhi, John McCarthy, sought to defend his country's
reputation Sunday and allay fears that foreign students were in danger.
</P>
<P>
"I would deny that we are a racist country. Australia is generally a safe
country," he told the NDTV news channel.
</P>
<P>
Indians form the second-largest group of overseas students in Australia, and
police estimate they make up 30 percent of robbery victims in Melbourne's
western suburbs, where many of the students live.

Myanmar's Suu Kyi upset after authorities enter home: party
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
YANGON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Myanmar democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi has accused the ruling junta of
"bullying" after authorities entered her home without permission while she is in
prison facing trial, her party said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Officials took US national John Yettaw to her lakeside house last week to stage
a reconstruction, for the purposes of the trial, of a bizarre incident in early
May in which he swam to her home, party spokesman Nyan Win said.
</P>
<P>
The Nobel laureate is on trial at Yangon's notorious Insein Prison and faces up
to five years in jail on charges of breaching the terms of her house arrest. She
has spent 13 of the past 19 years in detention.
</P>
<P>
"Aung San Suu Kyi said she is not completely satisfied as Mr Yettaw and the
authorities went into her compound last week for a demonstration (of how he got
into the property)," Nyan Win told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"It was not in accordance with the law. She said it was unjust bullying," added
Nyan Win, who is both the spokesman for her National League for Democracy party
and also part of her legal team.
</P>
<P>
Yettaw, a 53-year-old Mormon and former US military veteran, was arrested on May
6 after swimming to Aung San Suu Kyi's house using a pair of homemade flippers
and spending two nights there. He is also on trial.
</P>
<P>
Critics say Myanmar's military regime has trumped up the charges in a bid to
keep her locked up ahead of elections in 2010, as the latest six-year period of
her house arrest expired on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nyan Win said that despite the apparently unfortunate timing of the incident,
Aung San Suu Kyi did not harbour hard feelings against Yettaw.
</P>
<P>
"She also said she has no grudge to Mr Yettaw and his family," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi told the trial last week that she had not violated her house
arrest and that she had only offered Yettaw ""temporary shelter" as he was ill.
</P>
<P>
She insisted that she could not be held responsible as the junta had failed to
boost security despite her having reported that Yettaw made a previous visit to
the house in November 2008.
</P>
<P>
But Major General Aye Myint, Myanmar's deputy defence minister, told a security
forum in Singapore on Sunday that Aung San Suu Kyi had "committed a cover-up of
the truth" by failing to report Yettaw's visit in May.

Fate of Tamil Tiger spy chief unclear: report
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Colombo, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sri Lankan military is probing the possibility that the Tamil Tiger's spy
chief may still be alive, despite testimony that he was killed with the rest of
the rebel leadership.
</P>
<P>
"The military is still investigating Tiger intelligence wing leader Pottu
Amman's death as they could not find his body among the top level Tiger
leaders," the state-run Sunday Observer said.
</P>
<P>
Amman was seen as the number two in the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
hierarchy after rebel leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and was believed to have
masterminded the 1991 assassination of Indian premier Rajiv Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, which reflects government policy, said the military had testimony
from a surrendered Tiger cadre who claimed that the spy leader had been killed
before the final battle in which Prabhakaran perished.
</P>
<P>
However, no body was ever found.
</P>
<P>
Amman is the subject of an international arrest warrant for the Gandhi slaying
as well as the 1996 bombing of the Sri Lankan Central Bank which killed 91
people.
</P>
<P>
The Observer said the military could not confirm the deaths of Prabhakaran's
wife, Mathiwathini, and their daughter, Dwarka, although they were suspected to
have been in the same area during the final military offensive against the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
The military on Thursday identified Prabhakaran's parents, who had sought
shelter with security forces after fleeing the conflict zone.
</P>
<P>
Government troops announced the defeat of the LTTE two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Tamils displaced by the fighting are now being held in camps ringed by
barbed wire and security forces, who say they need to weed out former rebel
fighters disguised as civilians.

Student bashings strain Australia-India relations
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Melbourne, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Indian students rallied in Melbourne on Sunday as Australia scrambled to contain
outrage over a wave of attacks that has seen it labelled racist and strained
diplomatic relations with New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
What began as a local policing issue in Australia's second largest city has
spiralled into a crisis that prompted Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to call his
Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh last week to assure him about student safety.
</P>
<P>
The students are demanding action after more than 70 assaults on their peers in
a year in Melbourne, including at least four in the past fortnight, and there
has been prominent coverage in newspapers here and in India.
</P>
<P>
Pictures from a hospital bed of a comatose Sravan Kumar Theerthala, who was
stabbed with a screwdriver by gatecrashers at a party, were splashed across
newspapers in India. A teenager has been charged with attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
"They were saying, 'Don't touch us you Indians' and 'Indians go home' before
they got the screwdriver," said Theerthala's friend, Jayasanka Bagpelli.
</P>
<P>
Another student, Baljinder Singh, told Australian public radio last week how his
attackers laughed as he pleaded with them during a robbery at a Melbourne train
station.
</P>
<P>
"I was saying to them, 'I'm giving you all my money, don't kill me, don't kill
me'," said Singh, who was stabbed and left with a six-inch (15-centimetre) wound
to his stomach and advised Indians to stay away from Australia.
</P>
<P>
Indian media have dubbed the attacks "curry bashings", picking up on a term
reportedly used by some of the youths behind the violence in Melbourne's western
suburbs, where police say 30 percent of assault victims are Indian.
</P>
<P>
It is a grossly disproportionate figure in a city of almost four million people
where the Indian student population numbers less than 50,000.
</P>
<P>
Police deny any racial element to the attacks, arguing Indian students were
often simply in the wrong place at the wrong time as they travelled home late at
night with items such as mobile phones and portable MP3 players.
</P>
<P>
But Indian High Commissioner to Australia Sujatha Singh said last week that
racism was playing a part, even if some of the crimes were "opportunistic".
</P>
<P>
Federation of Indian Students president Amit Menghani, who led the rally of more
than a thousand supporters through central Melbourne Sunday, said the police
attitude had frustrated many students.
</P>
<P>
Bagpelli, who attended the rally, added: "It's only because the Indian
government is now applying pressure that they are doing anything."
</P>
<P>
While the attacks are unlikely to result in any permanent damage at a diplomatic
level, Canberra is concerned parents in India may prevent their children
studying in Australia.
</P>
<P>
That would threaten the international education sector here, a 15.5 billion
dollar (12.2 billion US) a year industry that has attracted more than 90,000
Indians to the country.
</P>
<P>
More broadly, with headlines such as "Australia, land of racism" running in
overseas media, there are also fears Australia's reputation for tolerance is
sustaining long-term damage.
</P>
<P>
A string of government ministers have made statements recently emphasising the
country's multi-cultural society and relatively low levels of violence.
</P>
<P>
"We need to help make sure that the mothers and fathers of all students who come
here are assured that Australia is a safe location to come to, that our general
crime rates and violence rates are very low," Foreign Minister Stephen Smith
told commercial television Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The assault on Theerthala proved the catalyst, High Commissioner Singh
describing it as a particularly distressing case.
</P>
<P>
It sparked a flurry of high-level diplomatic activity and strong public
statements from Indian officials that indicated they had run out of patience.
</P>
<P>
"Such attacks cannot be allowed to happen," Singh said.

Indian author Kamala Das dead at 75

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Writer and poet Kamala Das, known for her frank discussion of female sexuality
in conservative India, died in hospital on Sunday, the Press Trust of India
reported. She was 75.
</P>
<P>
Das died in the western city of Pune after a long illness, PTI said, without
specifying the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
Das was born into a family of writers and wrote poems and short stories in
English and Malayalam, the language of her southern home state of Kerala.
</P>
<P>
She was one of the first Indian writers to explore sexual themes in her work,
and her 1976 autobiography, My Story, was a candid recollection of her own
sexual coming of age that was translated into 15 languages.
</P>
<P>
Das converted to Islam in 1999 and took the name Kamala Surayya, but later
appeared to regret it, saying "God has no connection with any religion. There is
no respect for women anywhere."
</P>
<P>
She also dabbled in politics, launching the Lok Seva Party but failing to win a
seat in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Das is survived by two sons.

GM bondholders approve debt restructuring deal: report
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ailing General Motors moved closer Sunday to its expected bankruptcy filing as
company bondholders approved a  government-sponsored debt for equity deal, The
New York Times reported.
</P>
<P>
The bondholders had until 5:00 pm (2100 GMT) Saturday to indicate whether they
supported the group's new offer ahead of the once mighty corporation's looming
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The government's rescue plan for GM could put as much as 72.5 percent of the
country's biggest automaker under state ownership.
</P>
<P>
Citing "people briefed on the matter," the newspaper said the bondholders with
slightly more than 50 percent of GM’s 27.2 billion dollars in bond debt agreed
to support the plan by the government-set deadline.
</P>
<P>
Among the backers was a committee of large investors holding about 20 percent of
GM’s outstanding bonds, The Times said.
</P>
<P>
No official announcement of the vote tally has yet been made.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the bondholders would obtain the rights to buy an extra 15
percent of GM's stock at a low price. They would also control 25 percent of the
"new GM," after having supported the new company's creation in bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
Recalcitrant bondholders who opt for confrontation rather than cooperation "will
get nothing or very little," an Obama administration official told reporters
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Government-backed restructuring in bankruptcy court for GM, once the world's
largest automaker, appeared all but certain ahead of a Monday deadline imposed
by the Obama administration on the company to submit a viable restructuring plan
or file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
It could take place as early as Sunday.

Sri Lanka seeks help in dismantling Tigers' global network
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Singapore, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sri Lanka appealed Sunday for support in dismantling the Tamil Tigers'
international support network after declaring victory over the rebels following
the decades-long conflict.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama told a high-level security forum in
Singapore that the global organisation of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) remained "largely intact."
</P>
<P>
"Many of the operatives have clearly cultivated powerful, political lobbies in
certain capitals with a view to resurrecting the LTTE," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for the international community to take all measures to assist
the government of Sri Lanka to track down the global network of the LTTE," he
told an annual forum of defence and military officials organised by the London-
based International Institute for Strategic Studies.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's military claimed complete victory over the separatist Tamil Tigers
after wiping out the guerrillas' leadership nearly two weeks ago, but has been
dogged by accusations that thousands of civilians were killed in the final weeks
of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE launched a campaign in 1972 to create a Tamil homeland in the
Sinhalese-majority island. Much of its funding came from Tamils overseas.
</P>
<P>
Bogollagama dismissed allegations that heavy weapons were used by the military
in civilian areas as part of the "propaganda of genocide against the Tamil
people."
</P>
<P>
"This was both fictional and well-fabricated, with ulterior and sinister motives
in order to discredit the armed forces as well as to embarrass the government of
Sri Lanka," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Sri Lanka will no doubt enter the annals of history as a classic textbook
example of a nation that successfully prevailed over the scourge of terrorism,
whilst tenaciously upholding the cherished values of democracy and human rights
that have been deeply engraved in the psyche of our people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The government is firmly committed to reaching a political settlement
acceptable to all," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's handling of the LTTE "has sent a strong signal to the international
community that terror can be defeated and terrorism can be eliminated," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty International called Saturday for an independent probe into the number
of civilians killed following a report in London's Times newspaper citing
confidential UN reports that said more than 20,000 civilians were killed by Sri
Lankan army shelling.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's Human Rights Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe has dismissed Amnesty's
call and said the organisation was being "ridiculous to keep harping on things
they cannot substantiate."

Boxing: Berto retains WBC welterweight title
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HOLLYWOOD, Florida, May 30, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Haitian-born American Andre Berto retained his World Boxing Council welterweight
title Saturday with a lopsided unanimous 12-round decision over Colombian Juan
Urango.
</P>
<P>
Two judges scored the bout 118-110 for the Florida-based Berto, while a third
saw it 117-111.
</P>
<P>
Berto remained unbeaten in 25 professional fights, with 19 wins inside the
distance.
</P>
<P>
Urango was frustrated by the nimble Berto, who kept his distance and scored to
the head with the jab and with his right.
</P>
<P>
Urango' best round was the fourth, when he landed a series of lefts to the head
and body.
</P>
<P>
But Berto largely avoided Urango's pressure, givig him little opportunity to get
inside in the middle rounds while connecting himself with shots to Urango's head
with both hands.
</P>
<P>
After a lackluster ninth round drew jeers from the crowd, Berto stepped it up in
the last three rounds.
</P>
<P>
Urango, who fell to 21-2-1 with 16 wins inside the distance, will now return to
the super lightweight ranks, where he is still the International Boxing
Federation title holder.

Taliban take war to Pakistan cities
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Islamabad, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taliban rebels in Pakistan are taking their war to the cities, honing terror
tactics to maximise civilian carnage after suffering heavy losses in a
blistering military offensive, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has been rocked by 14 bomb blasts that have killed more than 80 people
in urban areas since it launched a determined air and ground assault against the
Taliban in pockets of the northwest at the end of April.
</P>
<P>
The military said on Saturday that troops had regained control of the main town
of Mingora in Swat valley from the Taliban, in what is being touted as a
significant milestone in the month-long ongoing offensive.
</P>
<P>
But the rebels, who Washington fears threaten Pakistan's very existence, are
striking back in cities like the regional capital Peshawar, about 200 kilometres
(125 miles) from Mingora and previously shielded from major attacks.
</P>
<P>
"They are taking this war to the cities, hoping to build up enough pressure on
the government to halt the military activity," security analyst Hasan Askari
told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban challenge now threatens routine life and commercial activity in
cities... allied extremist groups are facilitating their agenda," he added.
</P>
<P>
Attackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated, analysts say, executing
commando-style assaults armed with suicide vests, vehicle bombs, guns, grenades
and rockets.
</P>
<P>
Over the last two weeks in Peshawar, bombs have exploded outside a cinema, near
crowded electronics shops, at a police checkpoint and even alongside a bus full
of children with special needs.
</P>
<P>
And in Lahore, Pakistan's entertainment capital, a bomb, gun and grenade assault
killed 24 people and partially damaged the provincial headquarters of the
country's premier spy agency on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was the third spectacular assault in and around the eastern city -- hundreds
of miles from the offensive in the northwest -- in as many months.
</P>
<P>
The Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP) militant group claimed responsibility, telling
people in a statement they should get out of the cities because there will be
more violence to come.
</P>
<P>
Newspaper columnist Shafqat Mehmood said the Taliban, who want to enforce sharia
law, are becoming more and more desperate in the face of the military onslaught
in the northwest, which the army says has claimed 1,200 rebels.
</P>
<P>
"Militants are under pressure and will employ any tactic to cause maximum
damage. Urban terrorism is one of those tactics," said Mehmood.
</P>
<P>
While the government could do more to protect key targets, he said, underfunded
and overstretched security forces can only do so much.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to patrol markets and streets," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Our province is facing a war-like situation," the police chief of North West
Frontier Province, Malik Naved Khan, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"We have 9,000 police. In a big city like Peshawar, this is not enough to deal
with situations like the one we're facing," said Khan.
</P>
<P>
Northwest expert Rahimullah Yusufzai said the Taliban were increasingly focused
on civilian targets as widespread public opinion turns -- for the first time --
in favour of Pakistan's military operation.
</P>
<P>
The offensive already has the firm backing of Washington, which says Al-Qaeda
and Taliban have carved out safe havens in the northwestern areas bordering
Afghanistan to plot terror attacks on the West.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban have jacked up attacks targeting civilians as they have failed to
target security forces," Yusufzai said.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Hasan Askari, he added the Taliban will likely have willing allies from
a catalogue of banned radical groups that traditionally have battled India in
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
These include Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, Yusufzai said, an extremist element linked to
Al-Qaeda, and Lashkar-e-Taiba, accused of carrying out the Mumbai attacks last
year that left 166 dead.
</P>
<P>
"These extremist outfits and TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban) have a relationship that
runs in their blood. They are natural allies who lived and fought together."
</P>
<P>
Alarmingly, the government in Islamabad had no particular strategy to prevent
attacks on cities, Yusufzai said, warning he did not see an end to the urban
bloodshed any time soon.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the situation can be brought under control quickly because it has
roots in (the tribal areas of) Waziristan and Bajaur, and what is happening in
those two regions is linked to the Taliban in Afghanistan," he said.

Aung San Suu Kyi 'covered up' truth: Myanmar junta
</HEADLINE>

Singapore, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi "covered up" the truth by failing to report
an American man in her home, a senior Myanmar official said Sunday, warning
foreigners not to interfere in the case.
</P>
<P>
"It is no doubt that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has committed a cover-up of the truth
by her failure to report an illegal immigrant to the authorities concerned,"
Major General Aye Myint, Myanmar's deputy defence minister, told a security
forum in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"Thus there was no option but to open legal proceedings in accordance with the
law," he said.
</P>
<P>
"She permitted him to stay.... She communicated, provided him food and shelter,"
Aye Myint said.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel peace laureate, is facing up to five years' detention
on charges relating to the surprise visit of an eccentric American to her
lakeside prison home in early May.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to regional security officials and experts, the general said the
case against Aung San Suu Kyi was an internal matter for Myanmar to resolve
without foreign intervention.
</P>
<P>
"Countries should refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of Myanmar
that will affect peace and security of the region," sid Aye Myint.
</P>
<P>
"Solving one's internal affairs through its legal system with legal proceedings
in accordance with law does not amount to the threat of peace or breach of
security of the region," he said in an apparent reaction to criticism of the
charges against Aung San Suu Kyi from other forum participants.
</P>
<P>
Ann Taylor, Britain's minister for international defence and security, said at
the meeting earlier Sunday that Aung San Suu Kyi should be released.
</P>
<P>
"The continued imprisonment of Aung San Suu Kyi by the Burmese regime is a
reminder that we cannot take for granted the institution of democracy," she
said, referring to Myanmar by its former name.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Burma have suffered for nearly half a century of conflict and
isolation, but Aung San Suu Kyi is not alone," Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
"People all around the world are standing with her and the Burmese people and we
say to the generals: Now is the time for transition to democracy starting with
the release of Aung San Suu Kyi."

Basketball: Magic beat Cavaliers to book NBA finals berth
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ORLANDO, Florida, May 30, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orlando Magic will battle the Los Angeles Lakers for the National Basketball
Association title after defeating Cleveland 103-90 on Saturday in game six of
the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
Orlando's "Superman" Dwight Howard poured in 40 points for the Magic, who are
returning to the NBA finals championship series for the first time in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
To get there they stunned Cleveland - the team with the best regular-season
record in the league and Most Valuable Player LeBron James - four-games-to-two
in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
The Magic will be making their first finals appearance since 1995, one year
before Shaquille O'Neal departed as a free agent for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Rashard Lewis added 18 points for the Magic, who hit 12 3-pointers in the
victory.
</P>
<P>
"Total domination," Lewis said of Howard's performance. "He totally dominated
the game. He carried us on his back tonight."
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers had won 66 regular-season games and won both of their opening
playoff series in four-game sweeps.
</P>
<P>
But Orlando pushed them to the brink of defeat with a 116-114 overtime victory
on Tuesday that gave the Magic a 3-1 series lead.
</P>
<P>
Cleveland had responded with a victory on Thursday to force Saturday's game, but
could get no further.
</P>
<P>
Orlando will travel to Los Angeles for game one against the Lakers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Magic had beaten Philadelphia in six games and then beat the reigning
champion Boston Celtics in seven games before subduing "King" James and the
Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
"I just think this team all year long has shown an incredible amount of heart,"
Magic coach Stan Van Gundy said. "This team just keeps fighting back. They
deserve it."
</P>
<P>
James scored 25 points with seven rebounds and seven assists in his least-
impressive outing of the series. He was scoreless in the second quarter as the
Magic seized an 18-point lead.
</P>
<P>
The defeat overshadowed the fact that James had a superb series, averaging more
than 38 points, eight rebounds and eight assists in the six games.
</P>
<P>
However, he had too little support from his teammates, with Mo Williams
struggling to score and Orlando's bench solidly outplaying Cleveland's reserves.
</P>
<P>
A dejected James left the arena without speaking to the media.
</P>
<P>
After Howard slammed home a dunk with 2:21 to play, the chant of "Beat LA!" went
up from the Orlando crowd - which included golf superstar Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
Howard was even solid from the free-throw line, making 12 of 16 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
While Cleveland powered through the regular season, the Magic had to contend
with a season-ending shoulder injury to point guard Jameer Nelson in February.
</P>
<P>
Orlando brought in guard Rafer Alston in a trade with Houston and helped revive
the team's playoff bid.
</P>
<P>
For Howard, the top draft selection in 2004, it was a vindication of his
prediction two years ago that the Magic could challenge for the title.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody laughed," Howard said. "I mean everyone."
</P>
<P>
Now the Magic are looking forward to another tough series.
</P>
<P>
"You guys like to talk about pressure," said Mickael Pietrus, who scored 14
points off the bench for the Magic. "It's a game of basketball. They made the
game to compete for the trophy. Every game is a dogfight.
</P>
<P>
"Basketball is what we like, what we share with 20,000 fans every night," he
said. "It's fun."

<P>
Polling stations opened Sunday across the breakaway Georgian region of South
Ossetia for legislative elections, less than one year after Moscow and Tbilisi
clashed over the province.
</P>
<P>
Four parties are competing for the 34 seats in the parliament, but the central
election commission has barred the only two parties not loyal to president
Eduard Kokoity.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Kokoity is seeking to use the vote to forge a loyal parliamentary
majority to be able to push through an amendment to the constitution to allow
him to run again for office when his second term is up next year.
</P>
<P>
Eighty eight polling stations have been set up for the region's 50,000
residents, plus additional sites in Russia for expatriates and refugees from the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
Moscow and Tbilisi fought a brief war over the region last August, which had
enjoyed de facto independence since the early 1990s thanks to tacit Russian
support. Following the conflict Russia formally recognised the region, a move
followed only by Nicaragua.

Voting ends at 8 pm (1600 GMT), with the first results expected two hours later.

seven series.
</P>
<P>
Franzen and Brad Stuart both had goals that went off Pittsburgh goalie Marc-
Andre Fleury.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to get goals like that," Red Wings coach Mike Babcock said.
"I don't think there are going to be a whole lot of skill plays."
</P>
<P>
There was no fortuitous bounce of the puck for Pittsburgh's Sidney Crosby, whose
third-period shot bounced off Osgood and a post and landed on the sprawled
goalie's back.
</P>
<P>
"It's a race to four, and they got one," said Penguins coach Dan Bylsma, whose
team will try to even the score in game two on Sunday in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
Crosby and Evgeni Malkin, the two leading scorers in the postseason, were
limited to one assist between them - by Malkin.
</P>
<P>
"When you're on the road, the goal is win one of two, and if we play the way we
did in the second period for 60 minutes, we like our chances," Pittsburgh
forward Max Talbot said. "When they get the lead they're a very good team, so
maybe we need to get the lead (in game two).
</P>
<P>
Detroit rookie Justin Abdelkader gave the Red Wings a little extra breathing
room with his first career playoff goal early in the third period.
</P>
<P>
Detroit welcomed back Swedish defensemen Nicklas Lidstrom and Jonathan Ericsson,
and they played a key role in containing Crosby and Malkin.
</P>
<P>
Red Wings captain Lidstrom had missed the last two games of the Western
Conference finals against Chicago with a lower body injury, while Ericsson
played just three days after having an appendectomy.
</P>
<P>
"They're a huge help on the blue line," Red Wings forward Darren Helm said. "The
guys that played in their absence did an unbelievable job, but definitely having
Nick, one of the best 'D' in the league, for him to come back and play against
Crosby all night and keep him off the scoreboard's really big for this team."
</P>
<P>
Crosby and the Penguins are seeking to avenge their six-game loss to Detroit in
last year's finals.
</P>
<P>
It's the first Stanley Cup finals rematch in 25 years, and Stuart put the Red
Wings ahead when he deposited the puck behind Fleury and saw it carom off Fleury
and into the net with 6:22 to play in the opening period.
</P>
<P>
"I think he sat on it and pushed it in the net," Stuart said. "One of those
lucky breaks - but we'll take it."
</P>
<P>
The Penguins answered as Malkin capitalized on turnover with a slap shot that
Osgood couldn't control, leading to Ruslan Fedotenko's backhander off the
rebound.
</P>
<P>
Detroit went ahead 2-1 in the final minute of the second period when Brian
Rafalski's shot bounced off the boards and Franzen corralled the loose puck and
flipped a backhander over and off of the goalie.

Blogging guru chips away at Great Firewall of China

Hong Kong, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How would you react if one million of your customers were suddenly stopped from
coming into your shop? Matt Mullenweg just shrugged.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old American is the founder of Wordpress, software that allows
computer users worldwide to easily create their own websites, or blogs.
</P>
<P>
The simplicity of Wordpress has made it one of the world's top blogging
platforms six years after it was set up, its adherents ranging from knitting
fanatics (jessinohio.wordpress.com) to CNN's resident doctor Sanjay Gupta
(pagingdrgupta.blogs.cnn.com/site).
</P>
<P>
But in 2006, as the site was growing from strength to strength, Chinese
authorities suddenly blocked it.
</P>
<P>
Overnight, one million Chinese visitors to the various blogs disappeared,
accounting for about a quarter of all traffic to the site.
</P>
<P>
"I wish there was a better story, but really it just went away one day and we
didn't know what to do about it," Mullenweg told AFP, during a visit to Hong
Kong to speak to some of his bloggers.
</P>
<P>
After some discussions, Mullenweg realised the site would be allowed back online
if he agreed to block certain words or topics and give up information to the
Chinese communist government about users.
</P>
<P>
"I started thinking about the DNA of the company," he said. "That sort of
company is not one I would wake up every day and feel passionate about working
in."
</P>
<P>
The site remains blocked, although Mullenweg, unable to suppress a giggle,
points out that the official Chinese line insists it is freely available.
</P>
<P>
His decision not to pander to China contrasts sharply with other companies that
have agreed to the country's extensive Internet controls -- often dubbed the
Great Firewall of China -- in the hope of gaining access to what is now the
world's biggest online market.
</P>
<P>
Yahoo! faced fierce criticism when it helped Chinese authorities identify a
journalist who had passed on a sensitive Communist Party message to foreign
websites. The journalist, Shi Tao, was subsequently jailed in 2005.
</P>
<P>
"I imagine that weighs very heavily on both the leadership of that company and
also the morale of an entire organisation," said Mullenweg, who is based in San
Francisco and has done several recent deals with Yahoo!.
</P>
<P>
Despite the ban, Chinese bloggers still use Wordpress technology in huge
numbers, downloading its free access software and pasting their blogs through
another server to avoid the censors.
</P>
<P>
That's just the kind of technology-inspired rebellion that appeals to Mullenweg,
who has also refused to submit to similar government demands in Turkey, and
whose instinct is to make things freely-available.
</P>
<P>
He is considering putting all the firm's expenses online, so everyone at
Automattic, Wordpress's parent company, can access them. And his camera, which
goes everywhere with him, carries a global positioning system, so he records the
exact location of all his pictures.
</P>
<P>
This openness is reflected in Wordpress's approach -- the blogging software is
open source, so it can be downloaded and tinkered with as users see fit.
</P>
<P>
As a result of its accessibility and it simplicity, it now has more than 15
million bloggers using its technology, according to statistics on the site.
</P>
<P>
While setting up a blog is free, the site makes money by advertising or charging
for extras, such as enhanced statistics packages or better promotion of a
particular blog.
</P>
<P>
Mullenweg has become the darling of the Internet world, regularly featuring on
lists of the "most powerful people in cyberspace" and accepting invitations to
talk about how the web is changing the world.
</P>
<P>
The company, which still has fewer than 100 employees, remains privately held
and so does not have to reveal earnings, and though reports have said Mullenweg
turned down an offer of 200 million dollars in 2007 for a stake in the firm,
money one of the few subjects he is reluctant to discuss.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing well, capital is not a limiting factor for us," said Mullenweg,
dressed in battered trainers and jeans after addressing a group of business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
"I like that we always get the question how do you make money, because it means
that we are not crassly over-commercialising," he said.
</P>
<P>
His passion for simplicity was learned as teenage volunteer at the Houston Area
League of PC Users, in the US city where he grew up. His job was fixing
computers every Saturday for mainly elderly PC users.
</P>
<P>
"You saw all the cliches -- CD-ROMS being used as a cup holder, but they were
just trying to connect with (the technology). It was inspiring," he said.
</P>
<P>
"You really develop an appreciation (for simplicity) and developing software is
the same.
</P>
<P>
"People don't want to use Wordpress (for its own sake), they want to talk to
their audience, share photos of their family and (Wordpress) is either a way for
them to do that or it is not."

Nia Vardalos back in spotlight after big fat Greek hit
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Los Angeles, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven years after being catapulted to fame and fortune with her hit comedy "My
Big Fat Greek Wedding", Nia Vardalos makes a long-awaited return to the big
screen this month with another film that takes the Canadian-born actress back to
her ancestral roots.
</P>
<P>
Vardalos, 46, became an overnight success in 2002, when the romantic comedy she
wrote and starred in went on to become a monster hit, earning more than 350
million dollars worldwide after being made for only five million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The success of the film -- which also earned Vardalos a best original screenplay
nomination at the Oscars -- allowed Vardalos to take her time deciding her next
career move.
</P>
<P>
Although she starred in a short-lived television spin-off of "Greek Wedding",
Vardalos has been largely inactive since 2002 preferring to focus on starting a
family before relaunching her career with "My Life in Ruins."
</P>
<P>
Her new film, which goes on release in North America on June 5, sees her play a
Greek-American history professor who returns to Greece to work as a tour guide
in Athens.
</P>
<P>
Vardalos said the script for the film, which includes several scenes shot at the
Acropolis and other historic sites, had fired her enthusiasm after years out of
the spotlight as she attempted to start a family.
</P>
<P>
"When we got the permission to shoot this film, it was so exciting and it was
the first that I had found something where I wanted to be on camera in for a
long time," she told reporters in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
"In 2004, I had come to the end of a 10-year infertility battle and I just chose
to privately deal with it, so I stepped back out of acting," said Vardalos, who
recently adopted a three-year-old girl with her husband.
</P>
<P>
"I was really happy to be offered a nice clean script that celebrates Greece and
is a love letter to Greece," she adds.
</P>
<P>
Vardalos says that despite the commercial success of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding",
her business relationships with her producers, who include actor Tom Hanks and
his wife Rita Wilson, have not changed.
</P>
<P>
"The good news is that you strive for what happened with my first movie for your
whole life," Vardalos said. "And so it happened and its like, 'oh that's over,
the rest is gravy.'
</P>
<P>
"The greater news is that my producers are the same producers. They treated me
like gold before 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' made a dime. And they don't expect
anything from me, except let's have fun and let's tell fun stories."
</P>
<P>
Vardalos, who did not write "My Life In Ruins," continues to pen screenplays.
</P>
<P>
But she says she has resisted the temptation to try and regurgitate the formula
from "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" in an attempt to score another commercial
bullseye.
</P>
<P>
"I write little movies and then the rest is up to the audience," she said. "It's
the audience that made 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' a success.
</P>
<P>
"I think if you create with a financial goal in mind, artistically you are dead.
Its best to tell fun stories and let the audience decide."
</P>
<P>
However Vardalos makes no apologies for the fact that "My Life In Ruins" and
another upcoming film "I Hate Valentine's Day," which she wrote, directed and
stars in, are both romantic comedies, like "Greek Wedding."
</P>
<P>
"I think that reviewers and the industry think that romance is dead," Vardalos
said. "I think the audience wants it and needs it. I know I do.
</P>
<P>
"As I keep saying, as the average person, I like to escape into a movie. I like
movies like 'Terminator' and 'Star Trek' as well."

Ethiopia: lifting the mystery on rock churches 'built by angels'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LALIBELA, Ethiopia, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ancient mystery shrouding Lalibela, Ethiopia's revered medieval rock-hewn
churches, could be lifted by a group of French researchers given the go-ahead
for the first comprehensive study of this world heritage site legend says was
"built by angels".
</P>
<P>
The team will have full access to the network of 10 Orthodox chapels chiseled
out of volcanic rock -- some standing 15 metres (42 feet) high -- in the
mountainous heart of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Local lore holds they were built in less than 25 years by their namesake, the
13th-century King Lalibela, with the help of angels after God ordered him to
erect a "New Jerusalem".
</P>
<P>
The monolithic structures are located 500 kilometres (300 miles) north of the
capital Addis Ababa. Long a holy pilgrimage site in a land proud of its
Christian Orthodox heritage, they are also a travel draw in a poverty-stricken
country hoping to boost tourism.
</P>
<P>
The multidisciplinary team of historians, archaeologists, topographers and a
specialist in liturgy will spend several weeks probing the subterranean complex
to try to identify its origins.
</P>
<P>
Historian Marie Laure Derat, with the French Centre for Ethiopian Studies
(CFEE), said "there are several theories". In one, "an Egyptian patriarch was
believed to be the source of these structures, another says the 13th-century
King Lalibela built the site from scratch."
</P>
<P>
"During the day the king would work with Ethiopian artisans and at night he
would 'be helped by angels'. Some even cite a key role by the Knights Templar,"
she said, referring to one of the key Western Christian military orders of the
Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
Though earlier studies have been carried out, they were generally by lone
researchers with restricted access who studied mainly church interiors .
</P>
<P>
Derat said the heretofore reluctant Orthodox church gave the French team carte
blanche to probe "the entire site, not just the churches, to understand how the
periods overlap and to read history in this open book that is Lalibela".
</P>
<P>
Funded by the French government and Ethiopian Airlines, the team is already
certain the chapels were not built in one go.
</P>
<P>
Research chief Francois Xavier Fauvelle said three distinct periods have been
identified in the maze of deep tunnels, passageways and chapels, some of which
resemble ancient Greek temples.
</P>
<P>
"There was originally a basalt dome under which we found evidence of cave
dwellers. Then there was the construction of a fortress with trenches, a
perimetre wall and underground tunnels," he said pointing to rocks he said where
once part of the defence wall.
</P>
<P>
"The third period was established thanks to an enormous mound of earth about 20
metres high that came from the excavation of the church of Gabriel Ruphael," he
said, referring to the chapel some believe was once King Lalibela's residence.
</P>
<P>
"The Ruphael Gabriel church was probably part of the fortress and was turned
into a church: the facade was extended, windows opened and a chapel dug out,"
said Fauvelle.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO added Lalibela to its world heritage list in 1978, a boon for tourism
efforts in this country of 85 million where poverty is rampant and agriculture
accounts for nearly half the economy. Visitors can already join organized tours
of the site.
</P>
<P>
But the bid to shed light on its origins has not shaken the Orthodox clergy and
faithful here, who contend that Lalibela arose with divine intervention.
</P>
<P>
"It is God through his angels who made these churches," said Alebachew Reta,
spokesman for the Lalibela clergy who insisted "the 10 churches were created in
just 24 years."
</P>
<P>
"You can observe that even one would be difficult to build in that space of
time. So for us it is God's work," said Reta. "For the one who created mankind,
building these churches was not difficult."

Jewish settlers say they remain in West Bank on God's orders
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Havat Gilad, West Bank, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The world outcry over Israeli settlements in the West Bank is absurd since God
gave this land to the Jews, says Rabbi Yaakov Savir. The Arabs, he says, should
make their home elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
"This territory is Jewish territory," says Savir, a settler who runs a religious
school in the Havat Gilad outpost which consists of little more than a few tin
huts and weather-worn trailers, some horses and chickens and several car wrecks.
</P>
<P>
"This is our home," he says, making a sweeping gesture towards the Jewish
settlements that dominate nearby hilltops to show he means the entire West Bank,
which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Six-Day-War.
</P>
<P>
Havat Gilad, which 20 families call home, is a wildcat outpost, meaning that
unlike full-scale settlements, it is not authorised by the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
The international community considers all settlements illegal, and the issue is
one of the thorniest in peace efforts with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
With US pressure mounting, Israel could soon make good on its years-old pledge
to tear down a couple of dozen outposts.
</P>
<P>
In Havat Gilad's case, it wouldn't be the first time.
</P>
<P>
Built by Moshe Zar, a former member of a Jewish underground movement that
planted bombs in the cars of Arab mayors, the outpost was torn down by the
Israeli authorities barely hours after a group of teenagers pitched the first
tents in 2002. Rebuilding started the next day.
</P>
<P>
Savir is outraged the government of right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
would even consider bulldozing Jewish homes.
</P>
<P>
"Jewish people live here by Biblical right," he claims, standing in the trailer
that houses the religious school, surrounded by students who sport the look
favoured by ideologically motivated religious settlers -- long locks, knitted
skullcap, loose clothing and sandals.
</P>
<P>
Savir insists he has nothing against Arabs -- he won't speak of Palestinians
other than to say there is no such people.
</P>
<P>
"If Arabs want to stay, we won't kill them, we won't expel them.
</P>
<P>
"They are the ones who want to kill us, who don't want us to live in our home,"
he says.
</P>
<P>
"Arabs," he adds "should find another place to live."
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of the 280,000 Jews who live in the 120 West Bank settlements
which Israel considers legal, have moved to the area for economic reasons. But
the hardliners who share Savir's views that Jewish people have a God-given right
to the land are extremely vocal and at times violent.
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Savir is convinced the residents of Havat Gilad, like others in similar
outposts, "will certainly fight for every millimeter. No one will leave his
home."
</P>
<P>
Israel agreed in 2003 to freeze all settlement activity and raze wildcat
outposts but has not followed through on those commitments.
</P>
<P>
Outposts, typically located a few hundred metres (yards) from government-
authorised settlements, include anything from a few shacks to communities of
several dozen semi-permanent homes connected to the electricity and water grids.
</P>
<P>
Many of the 100 or so outposts were built on West Bank hills by militant
teenagers, known as "hilltop youths," with the aim of planting the seeds of new
full-fledged settlements.
</P>
<P>
A 2005 government-commissioned report said that in some cases officials
authorised seizure of private Palestinian land to create outposts, and
facilitated their connection to the water and power mains.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians see the outposts as part of a land grab and a scheme to further
consolidate Israel's control over the West Bank, which is home to 2.4 million
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Faced with mounting pressure from within his right-wing coalition on the one
hand and the United States on the other, Netanyahu has vowed to continue
building in existing settlement blocs while indicating he will dismantle wildcat
outposts.
</P>
<P>
But he has failed to placate either side.
</P>
<P>
The premier has faced fierce criticism from the right for his willingness to
tear down Jewish homes, and some blunt talk from Washington over settlement
expansion.
</P>
<P>
US President Barack Obama told Netanyahu during May 18 White House talks he
wants a complete freeze of settlement activity.
</P>
<P>
"Not some settlements, not outposts, not natural growth exceptions," Secretary
of State Hillary Clinton said, explaining the demand.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police did tear down Maoz Esther, north of the West Bank political
capital of Ramallah, on May 21, but the move was dismissed by Israeli media as a
meaningless token gesture. The outpost consisted of just seven tin and plywood
shacks.
</P>
<P>
One week after the demolition, one house had already been rebuilt and another
was being constructed without any hindrance from the authorities.
</P>
<P>
"We must settle here, God has ordered us to live on this land," says Daniel
Landesberg, 20, as he and a group of teenagers spread out cement being poured
out of a large concrete mixer truck to form the base of a new house.
</P>
<P>
Landesberg is a firm believer in the "doubling" tactic adopted by hardline
settlers.
</P>
<P>
"They tore down seven homes, we will build 14," he says, smiling.
</P>
<P>
And if the 14 are razed? "We'll build twice that many."

Struggling GM thrives in China
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Shanghai, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GM's overall future may look grim, but half a world away from Detroit in
Shanghai, business has never been better.
</P>
<P>
The US auto giant is beating sales records in China and may soon be exporting
Chinese-made cars to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it makes much difference to us. Obviously we'd prefer to have
this restructuring done outside the courts," Kevin Wale, GM China's president
and managing director, told AFP in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
"We operate as independent joint ventures here in China so we would continue
pretty much as we are today."
</P>
<P>
While GM pares back at home, it may add a plant in China to meet its goal of
doubling annual sales to two million within five years with products developed
for "the most important growth market in the world", Wale said.
</P>
<P>
That extra capacity could also help produce GM cars which for the first time
would be exported from China to the United States, under a proposal the
automaker has reportedly submitted to US lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
GM has proposed shipping 17,335 Chinese-made cars to the US in 2011 and
increasing that to 51,546 by 2014 -- representing 1.6 percent of its forecast
3.1 million cars five years from now, the Automotive News reported.
</P>
<P>
China led the world in auto sales in April, and GM China's joint ventures led
the pack, with sales rising 29.9 percent on year to 151,084 vehicles, driven by
demand for Buicks and small Wuling "bread vans" that cost less than 5,000
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely one of the market leaders here -- in drastic contrast to their
performance in the US," said Shen Jun, an auto analyst at Roland Berger.
</P>
<P>
GM's first Shanghai sales office opened in 1929, boasting: "Buick owners are
mostly the leading men in China."
</P>
<P>
Pu Yi, the last emperor, revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen and premier Zhou Enlai
all owned Buicks.
</P>
<P>
But that history is barely known, allowing GM to recast Buick as a car for
China's young and fast-growing middle class.
</P>
<P>
"Volkswagen has good prices and good quality, but their cars look very average,
not unique," said Li Pengxiang, a 29-year-old telecoms project manager,
referring to China's number two carmaker.
</P>
<P>
"These new (GM) models look fresh and suit young people."
</P>
<P>
GM has earned a reputation for savvy marketing with moves like enlisting "Prison
Break" star Wentworth Miller -- a top celebrity in China despite the show never
airing here legally -- to star in its latest campaign, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"They think they are doing much better than the parent company in the US," he
said, saying GM's success in China boils down to smart decisions, good timing
and luck that has put it far ahead of US rivals Ford and Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
GM teamed with China's largest automaker Shanghai Automotive Industry Group or
SAIC, in 1997 -- foreign carmakers here need a local joint venture partner --
after SAIC rejected Toyota and before Ford could sign a deal, Shen said.

<P>
Tension among joint venture partners is common, but GM and SAIC are known to
have unrivalled chemistry, according to Zhu Junyi, an auto analyst at the
Shanghai Information Centre.
</P>
<P>
GM spends heavily on research and development while delegating key
responsibilities to its partner, he said.
</P>
<P>
"German and Japanese investors are more reluctant to give away any leadership
role," Zhu said. "GM has done a better job with localisation."
</P>
<P>
GM's growing sales are impressive but competitors are growing faster -- Hyundai
shot up 74 percent on year last month while Nissan sales grew 55 percent, Shen
said.
</P>
<P>
Even as the Chinese market's growth slows -- to eight percent in 2008 after
years of double digit growth -- more players are piling in.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese automakers are steamrolling China's auto market," said Eric Xu,
head of Timer-Auto Consulting in Shanghai.

GM's collapse will mark end of a blue collar dynasty
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Detroit, Michigan, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The expected collapse of General Motors will mark the death of a blue collar
dynasty which bestowed upon generations of Americans the security of a job for
life and a ticket to the middle class.
</P>
<P>
"GM represented the good life," said Gary Chaison, a professor of labor
relations at Clark University.
</P>
<P>
"There was a social contract: you worked hard and the company would reward you
with job security and good pay," Chaison told AFP. "And this was something you
could pass on (to your kids.) It was an inheritance."
</P>
<P>
In towns and cities scattered across the midwest, GM's sprawling plants and the
businesses which cropped up to service them brought prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
The United Auto Workers union won wages high enough to allow factory workers to
own a home, a cottage, a boat, to take summer vacations in cars they bought with
employee discounts.
</P>
<P>
Their health insurance was paid for. Pensions would offer guaranteed income in
retirement. They worked for the biggest corporation in the world.
</P>
<P>
That dream began to slip away in the 1980s, when GM began shutting down plants
and shipping production to Mexico and Asia.
</P>
<P>
Once bustling company towns like Flint, Michigan -- memorialized in Michael
Moore's documentary "Roger &amp; Me" -- emptied and died. Abandoned houses and
darkened storefronts transformed the once rich region into the Rust Belt.
</P>
<P>
GM employed 440,000 hourly workers in the United States in 1981.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, that had dropped to 133,000. In the next eight years it would fall to
62,000.
</P>
<P>
The latest restructuring plan calls for the unionized workforce to shrink to
38,000 by 2011: less than a tenth of what it was two decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
But even through the downsizing and plant closures of the 1980s and 1990s, the
workers who remained at General Motors were able to hang onto their high wages
and benefits.
</P>
<P>
That ended in the latest round of restructuring, which began in 2005 and ended
with the union agreeing to slash benefits, cut wages in half for new workers,
and even give up the right to strike until 2015.
</P>
<P>
"It could have been worse," said Doug Bowman, the president of UAW Local 594 in
Pontiac, Michigan.
</P>
<P>
Bowman has worked for GM for 30 years and has watched employment at his complex
shrink from 14,000 in the late 1970s to 1,000 today.
</P>
<P>
He's anxiously awaiting news about whether his truck plant will be among 14 GM
plants slated for closure. But he's resigned himself to the massive concessions
the union has made in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"The one thing I regret is that we couldn't protect the retirees," he told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"We have no choice," said Jim Hall, another UAW official from Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
"We have to vote for the concessions to help the company survive."
</P>
<P>
But Hall hasn't given up hope. If GM manages to emerge from bankruptcy
protection, which it is expected to seek in the coming days, Hall thinks some of
jobs, and some of those benefits, might come back.
</P>
<P>
GM, which only months ago lost the title of the world's biggest automaker to
Toyota after holding it for 77 years, had made huge steps in recent years to
revitalize its products and slash its bloated structural costs.
</P>
<P>
But the restructuring cost billions and the debt-laden automaker was unable to
survive the collapse of auto sales last fall amid a credit crunch and deepening
recession.
</P>
<P>
GM racked up nearly 88 billion dollars in losses from 2005 through the first
quarter of 2009, and has only managed to keep its operations afloat in recent
months with 19.4 billion dollars in loans from the US Treasury.
</P>
<P>
The hope is that, like Chrysler, GM will emerge from bankruptcy in a matter of
weeks as a leaner, meaner company able to get back to the business of making
cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
But while the union is likely to hold a large stake in the new General Motors,
its power to shape the American social landscape through sheer numbers is gone.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly an era has ended," said Harley Shaiken, a labor expert from the
University of California - Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
"We're in uncharted waters."

Once the world's biggest corporation, GM faces collapse
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Detroit, Michigan, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once the biggest corporation in the world, steady growth overseas was unable to
rescue General Motors from spiralling losses in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1908, GM sold more vehicles than any other automaker from 1931 until
2008, when it was overtaken by Japan's Toyota.
</P>
<P>
The largest of the Detroit Three automakers, GM has seen its US market share
fall from a peak of 54 percent in the 1954 to just 22 percent in 2008.
</P>
<P>
It nonetheless sold a whopping 8.35 million vehicles in 2008 despite a collapse
in global auto sales amid a credit crunch and widening economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
GM last made a profit in 2004, earning 2.8 billion dollars, and has been
operating under ever-deepening restructuring plans ever since. It lost nearly 88
billion dollars from 2005 through the first quarter of 2009.
</P>
<P>
Global employment levels reached more than 850,000 in 1978, of which more than
600,000 were in the United States, making GM the nation's largest private
employer.
</P>
<P>
By 2005 it had already shrunk to 335,000 people and further cuts this year will
bring it below 200,000 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
GM's unionized workforce has taken the most dramatic hit. GM employed 440,000
hourly workers in the United States in 1981.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, that had dropped to 133,000 and the automaker ended 2008 with just
62,000.
</P>
<P>
The latest restructuring plan calls for the unionized workforce to shrink to
38,000 by 2011: less than a tenth of what it was two decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
Once studied in business schools for the success of its brands, which operated
as separate divisions aimed to satisfy different segments of the market, GM is
shedding most of its marks -- including Sweden's Saab, Hummer, Pontiac and
Saturn. It will concentrate on Cadillac, Buick, Chevrolet and GMC.
</P>
<P>
The latest restructuring plan will shrink GM's US dealer network by 40 percent
and will cut its US plants from 47 to 31.

Collapse of once mighty GM was decades in the making
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Chicago, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The downfall of General Motors comes after decades of mistakes and missteps
chipped away at the reputation and market share of the once mighty automaker and
buried the Detroit giant in debt.
</P>
<P>
"It'll have a huge impact in the United States because it's more than just a
corporation -- it's an icon," said Gary Chaison, a professor of labor relations
at Clark University.
</P>
<P>
"It represented manufacturing supremacy and good jobs for American workers.
That's gone."
</P>
<P>
GM, which only months ago lost the title of the world's biggest automaker to
Toyota after holding it for 77 years, had made huge steps in recent years to
revitalize its products and slash its bloated structural costs.
</P>
<P>
But the restructuring cost billions and the debt-laden automaker has fought hard
to survive the collapse of auto sales last fall amid a credit crunch and
deepening recession.
</P>
<P>
GM racked up nearly 88 billion dollars in losses from 2005 through the first
quarter of 2009.
</P>
<P>
It managed to keep its operations afloat in recent months with 19.4 billion
dollars in loans from the US Treasury but is now expected to seek bankruptcy
protection in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
"GM's problems go back at least three decades," said Terrence Guay, a professor
at Penn State's business school.
</P>
<P>
"The company became complacent in terms of products and customers, assuming that
American car-buyers would choose GM vehicles," he told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"They didn't take the Japanese threat seriously, and consequently steadily lost
market share to Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and other imports."
</P>
<P>
GM was a giant in its chrome-detailed heyday, employing more than 600,000 people
worldwide and 464,000 in the United States back in 1962 when it sold more than
half the cars in America.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1908, GM grew to be the largest private US employer, the world's
biggest company, had revenues higher than the gross domestic product of most
nations, and currently operates in 140 countries.
</P>
<P>
After transforming its plants to make planes, tanks and munitions during World
War II, GM expanded far beyond cars in the decades to follow, building
everything from trains and rockets to home air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
GM also helped expand the American middle class with the standard-setting high
wages and solid benefit packages won by hundreds of thousands of unionized auto
workers.
</P>
<P>
The phrase "what's good for GM is good for the country" became commonplace.
</P>
<P>
"Between 1921 and 1980 they never lost money," said Sean McAlinden, chief
economist at Michigan's Center for Automotive Research.
</P>
<P>
"The target was a 20 percent return on capital every year no matter what. And
they did it."
</P>
<P>
But GM and its Detroit neighbors, Ford and Chrysler, let their quality slip and
fumbled the shift to smaller, more fuel efficient vehicles in the wake of the
oil crises of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
"The baby boom generation has never forgiven them for the defects of the 1970s
and 80s," McAlinden told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"They will go to their graves without buying a GM vehicle."
</P>
<P>
Japanese automakers Toyota and Honda steadily gained market share first with the
low cost of their vehicles and then with their reputation for higher quality.
</P>
<P>
Plant closures became a part of the American motif and GM shed most of its
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
The Detroit Three were able to revive their fortunes in the 1990s with the
development of sport utility vehicles and the rising popularity of trucks, but
the profits were short-lived.
</P>
<P>
Japanese automakers responded to Detroit's hulking truck-based suvs with
smaller, more efficient car-based crossovers suvs and once again GM was slow to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
When fuel prices began to rise and consumers shifted away from gasoline guzzles,
GM's sales -- and profits -- crashed.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of plant closures and layoffs began in November 2005.
</P>
<P>
Since then, GM's US workforce has been slashed by nearly half from 160,000 at
the end of 2004 to 83,315 at the end of April.
</P>
<P>
The real problem, analysts say, is that GM waited too long to address the
ballooning "legacy costs" associated with supporting generations of retirees
with a US market share that had slipped to 26 percent by 2005.
</P>
<P>
GM's costs for each vehicle built were about 2,000 to 2,500 dollars higher than
the US plants of its Asian rivals.
</P>
<P>
GM was able to reach a historic deal with the United Auto Workers union to slash
labor costs in 2007, but only after spending 103 billion dollars to fund
pensions and retiree health care from 1993 through 2007.
</P>
<P>
And though GM has managed to dramatically improve its product quality and
offerings in recent years, it was too little too late.

Can GM succeed as 'Government Motors'?
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
General Motors, readying a massive bankruptcy filing backed by billions in
public funds, faces a complex set of challenges as a virtually nationalized
"Government Motors," analysts say.
</P>
<P>
With the US government expected to hold as much as 72.5 percent of the new firm
that would emerge from bankruptcy, analysts say a big question is whether GM can
concentrate on the difficult auto marketplace.
</P>
<P>
"The tricky part is to leave day-to-day management to the executives of the
company," said Jeremy Anwyl, chief executive at auto research firm Edmunds.com.
</P>
<P>
For the government, he said, "the temptation is to influence product decisions
based on political considerations instead of market considerations, and that's
always a danger."
</P>
<P>
Anwyl said it is too soon to tell how the matter will be handled by the
administration of President Barack Obama, which has pledged to get out of the
business as soon as GM gets back on its feet.
</P>
<P>
David Cole, chairman of the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research, said
the government officials "are smart, dedicated people, but they can't learn the
key issues of this industry in a short time."
</P>
<P>
Cole said the government can succeed if it focuses on the goal of restoring
profitability, getting taxpayer money repaid and then getting out of GM.
</P>
<P>
"If the government forces a company to go out of step with the reality of the
marketplace, that's a problem," Cole said.
</P>
<P>
"If you force the industry to build products they can't sell profitably, that's
a problem."
</P>
<P>
Cole said it was "almost unavoidable that the government will try to superimpose
other agendas" on the carmaker.
</P>
<P>
Cole and Anwyl said it would be a mistake for the government to use its role as
the financial backer of GM or Chrysler to push the firms into building certain
types of cars to meet environmental or other goals because consumer demands can
change quickly.
</P>
<P>
Anwyl said that with the current level of fuel prices, demand for small, fuel-
efficient cars is decreasing. He added the Obama administration's effort to
further boost fuel efficiency may hurt efforts to help Detroit automakers become
profitable again.
</P>
<P>
Peter Cohan, a management consultant and faculty member at Babson College, said
GM must keep a focus on "developing a line of products that can compete with
Toyota, Nissan and the rest of the world."
</P>
<P>
"I hope the government doesn't push GM to make hybrids just for the sake of
doing it but because it will be profitable strategy ... They need to design and
build a vehicle that will last longer than a Toyota with lower maintenance
costs."
</P>
<P>
Although some GM critics blame existing management for its woes, Anwyl said the
carmaker's biggest problems stemmed from decisions made years or even decades
earlier.
</P>
<P>
"These festered over the years and GM never really confronted them," he said.
</P>
<P>
The US government is expected to invest an additional 30 billion dollars to help
GM on top of its 20 billion dollars in loans, with most of the funds being
converted to the equity stake of as much as 72.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The US stake could be reduced by a share given to the governments of Canada and
Ontario province, expected to pitch in with around nine billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
John Pottow, a law professor and bankruptcy specialist at the University of
Michigan, said the proposed ownership structure raises a lot of hackles.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is terrified of government mandates as opposed to market forces," he
said. "But I take it as face value the government saying they want to be
reluctant shareholders."
</P>
<P>
GM vice chairman Robert Lutz said the administration is taking appropriate
measures to help an industry vital to the US economy, and praised Obama's
Automotive Task Force.
</P>
<P>
"Their prime goal is not to gain government control of the automobile industry,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"They absolutely don't want that ... their number one goal is to make us
successful. There finally is a realization that our country cannot remain
economically strong and militarily strong and have a global impact if it’s not
backed up by wealth-producing industries."

GM to lose prestigious spot on Dow
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New York, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
General Motors' fall from grace is not yet complete. The firm's expected
bankruptcy would spell its eviction from the Dow Jones coveted list of 30 top US
companies, of which GM has been a pillar since 1925.
</P>
<P>
Even if GM's court filing has not yet been inked, speculation is rife about
which firm might take its place on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as the
former behemoth's share price tumbled 47 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
GM's shares fell to 75 cents each on Friday, well below the one dollar minimum
for listing on the New York-based exchange.
</P>
<P>
It is a confluence of factors that means GM will suffer the same fate as AIG. In
September, the insurance giant was removed from the Dow Jones index two days
after its nationalization, replaced by Kraft Foods.
</P>
<P>
"Once a company files for bankruptcy protection it is disqualified from being
one of the 30 Dow components," said Dow spokesperson Sybille Reitz.
</P>
<P>
"We are aware of GM's situation and are taking steps accordingly. We have been
following the situation closely."
</P>
<P>
There is great competition to replace GM on the venerable list, which has served
as a bellwether for US business since it was launched in 1896.
</P>
<P>
One solution could be to replace GM with its rival Ford -- which has so far
managed to escape the crisis without government aid.
</P>
<P>
But Ford's share price is far from stellar, trading at around 5.75 dollars.
According to John Ogg of 247wallst.com, that makes the firm -- which had
previously been a member of the elite club -- an unlikely inductee.
</P>
<P>
One of the more frequently cited names is that of Wall Street darling Goldman
Sachs.
</P>
<P>
The investment giant should be one of the first to pay back government loans,
thanks to a share price of more than 144 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Colas, head of investment strategy at the BNY ConvergEx Group, said
that makes Goldman Sachs a favorite.
</P>
<P>
It may also have been helped by AIG's departure.
</P>
<P>
During the AIG shakeout in September the Dow Jones group noted that the exit of
one financial firm meant that that economically vital sector was under-
represented.
</P>
<P>
But there are other contenders. From the technology sector Apple, Google, Cisco
and Oracle are mentioned as possible replacements.
</P>
<P>
Google's candidature runs into the difficulty that its share price -- at over
400 dollars a piece -- may skew the index.
</P>
<P>
And technology stocks are already well represented by heavyweight IBM.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll by CNBC has further muddied the picture. The financial news
provider asked customers who should replace GM. The response was Abbott Labs, a
pharmaceuticals firm.
</P>
<P>
From the biotech field, Monsanto is an outsider. Owen Patrick of Deutsche Bank
pointed out that Monsanto was an important member of another index, the Standard
and Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
"It is a little smaller in market cap," said BNY's Colas, "and not as well
known, but its technology and competitive advantage would be unique in the Dow."
</P>
<P>
If the GM change has been keenly anticipated, that is because change on the Dow
is rare.
</P>
<P>
Only six firms have come in this decade, with three in 2008 including Kraft --
Bank of America and Chevron replaced Altria and Honeywell.
</P>
<P>
According to Ogg the index's managers may use the opportunity to dump other
listings hit by the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Citigroup, now trading at four dollars a share, must feel its head is on the
chopping block.

A power struggle in Malaysia's Islamic party will be put to the test in
leadership polls this week which pit hardline clerics against young moderates
who want to rebrand the party.
</P>
<P>
The Pan-Malaysia Islamic Party (PAS) has enjoyed a surge in popularity thanks to
deep public disillusionment with the Barisan Nasional coalition that has
governed the multiracial country for half a century.
</P>
<P>
PAS has formed an unlikely alliance with two other opposition parties which has
stuck together despite wide differences in their ideologies, giving them a
chance to unseat the coalition in the next elections due in several years.
</P>
<P>
But the PAS general assembly on June 5-7 will lay bare the dilemma at the
party's core -- whether to swing back to its hardline roots or to put on a more
moderate face to continue winning back support after some barren years.
</P>
<P>
"The party is at a threshold -- whether it can transcend its history of catering
largely to Muslims and put in place a model that everyone in the country
including non-Muslims can accept," said pollster Ibrahim Suffian.
</P>
<P>
"They need to be able to articulate issues relating to the economy, security,
international trade... to not only look after your hereafter, but look after
your here and today," said Ibrahim, from Merdeka Centre research.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 percent of Malaysians are Muslim Malays, but the population includes
large ethnic Chinese and Indian communities, and if PAS wants to break out
beyond its niche it needs to attract support from minorities.
</P>
<P>
Curiously, despite pushing for the creation of an Islamic state and the
introduction of "hudud" laws like chopping off thieves' hands, PAS has won the
trust and support of many non-Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and Indian voters have enthusiastically supported PAS candidates in
seats where they stood for the Pakatan Rakyat opposition alliance, and thousands
have joined PAS "Supporters' Clubs" around the country.
</P>
<P>
Much of the attraction stems from PAS's reputation as a clean party untainted by
the corruption which is endemic in the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
And in northern Kelantan state, where it has long been in power, minorities have
few complaints and are not obliged to observe local bylaws that discourage
skimpy clothing and high heels.
</P>
<P>
Reforms introduced before landmark 2008 elections, when the Pakatan Rakyat
snatched a third of parliamentary seats in an unprecedented performance,
reversed a decline that had seen PAS decimated in 2004 polls.
</P>
<P>
"They stopped talking about wanting to impose stricter sharia laws and they had
much more moderate faces in the party, people who were professionals and able to
converse in English," said Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
But this rebranding exercise is now in jeopardy with a vote for top leadership
posts, including the deputy presidency, which will see a clash between incumbent
Nasharuddin Mat Isa and challenger Husam Musa.
</P>
<P>
Husam is an economist who typifies the party's new generation of educated
professionals, while Nasharuddin is closely identified with the party's
conservative president Abdul Hadi Awang.
</P>
<P>
Husam is an ally of PAS's iconic spiritual leader Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat, a
quirky figure who is a highly respected religious leader and also a big
supporter of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
Nasharuddin meanwhile played a leading role in "secret" talks last year with the
ruling party UMNO -- which leads the Barisan Nasional coalition -- that were
hugely controversial within the party.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that if Nasharuddin retains his post, the fragile bonds between
the opposition partners will begin to erode, jeopardising its ability to
challenge the coalition.
</P>
<P>
"PAS is at a crossroads now. This meeting will see whether PAS is inclined to
have a good relationship with UMNO or have a good relationship with its
opposition partners," a party insider told AFP.
</P>
<P>
He said that a rebuke to Husam would also send out a negative message to non-
Muslims that it remains the "party of the ulamas", the elderly cohort of clerics
who have historically dominated the party.
</P>
<P>
"As a political party PAS has to go with the (reform) approach, that which is
accepted by the Malaysian people. During the last general election PAS had a lot
of support from non-Muslims and it has to maintain that," he said.

Danish Tiananmen sculptor denied entry to Hong Kong

Hong Kong, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Danish sculptor who flew to Hong Kong to protest the bloody crackdown on pro-
democracy protests in Beijing 20 years ago has been refused entry to the city,
an official and a legislator said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Jens Galschiot, whose sculpture commemorating those who died in the 1989
military crackdown, "Pillar of Shame," is displayed at Hong Kong University, was
stopped by officials Saturday, an immigration spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Albert Ho, the chairman of the Democratic Party and a lawyer, said the Dane was
detained for five hours before being put on a flight to Zurich late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Galschiot, who was also refused entry to the city ahead of the Beijing Olympics
last year, had planned to join the annual June 4 vigil to mark the anniversary
of the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
He was also planning to repair his sculpture and donate two more.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at the possibility of legal action following the decision," Ho
told AFP. Ho had been allowed to see Galschiot during his detention.
</P>
<P>
Other members of his family and a filmmaker accompanying them were allowed to
pass through immigration.
</P>
<P>
The Danish Consulate was not immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
The immigration department spokesman said it had acted in accordance with the
law.
</P>
<P>
The 20th anniversary of the crackdown on the protests -- which left hundreds,
possibly thousands, dead across the Chinese capital -- will be marked on
Thursday in Hong Kong with a candlelight vigil expected to draw tens of
thousands.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, which has a different legal system from the mainland, is the only
place in China where the anniversary is publicly commemorated.

Basketball: Magic beat Cavaliers to book NBA finals berth
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ORLANDO, Florida, May 30, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orlando Magic will battle the Los Angeles Lakers for the National Basketball
Association title after defeating Cleveland 103-90 on Saturday in game six of
the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
Orlando's "Superman" Dwight Howard poured in 40 points for the Magic, who are
returning to the NBA finals championship series for the first time in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
They downed Cleveland - the team with the best regular-season record in the
league and Most Valuable Player LeBron James - four-games-to-two in the best-of-
seven Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
The Magic will be making their first finals appearance since 1995, one year
before Shaquille O'Neal departed as a free agent for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Rashard Lewis added 18 points for the Magic, who hit 12 3-pointers in the
victory.
</P>
<P>
"Total domination," Lewis said of Howard's performance. "He totally dominated
the game. He carried us on his back tonight."
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers had won 66 regular-season games and won both of their opening
playoff series in four-game sweeps.
</P>
<P>
But Orlando pushed them to the brink of defeat with a 116-114 overtime victory
on Tuesday that gave the Magic a 3-1 series lead.
</P>
<P>
Cleveland had responded with a victory on Thursday to force Saturday's game, but
could get no further.
</P>
<P>
Orlando will travel to Los Angeles for game one against the Lakers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Magic had beaten Philadelphia in six games and then beat the reigning
champion Boston Celtics in seven games before subduing "King" James and the
Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
"I just think this team all year long has shown an incredible amount of heart,"
Magic coach Stan Van Gundy said. "This team just keeps fighting back. They
deserve it."
</P>
<P>
James scored 25 points with seven rebounds and seven assists in his least-
impressive outing of the series. He was scoreless in the second quarter as the
Magic seized an 18-point lead.
</P>
<P>
The defeat overshadowed the fact that James had a superb series, averaging more
than 38 points, eight rebounds and eight assists in the six games.
</P>
<P>
However, he had too little support from his teammates, with Mo Williams
struggling to score and Orlando's bench solidly outplaying Cleveland's reserves.
</P>
<P>
After Howard slammed home a dunk with 2:21 to play, the chant of "Beat LA!" went
up from the Orlando crowd - which included golf superstar Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
Howard was even solid from the free-throw line, making 12 of 16 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
While Cleveland powered through the regular season, the Magic had to contend
with a season-ending shoulder injury to point guard Jameer Nelson in February.
</P>
<P>
Orlando brought in guard Rafer Alston in a trade with Houston and helped revive
the team's playoff bid.

Two charged over plot to murder top Hong Kong democrat
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong Kong, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong police have charged two men over a plot to assassinate one of the
city's leading pro-democracy campaigners Martin Lee, a spokeswoman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two men -- aged 49 and 50 -- were due to appear in court on June 16, the
police spokeswoman told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The plot to kill Lee, a veteran activist and long-time critic of Beijing, was
revealed on Saturday, but took place last summer during elections for Hong
Kong's legislature.
</P>
<P>
The 70-year-old confirmed the plot Saturday, but said he had been asked by
police to keep silent after the two men were first arrested last August.
</P>
<P>
The South China Morning Post revealed the story, saying police had arrested an
alleged hitman from China and a Hong Kong accomplice.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman would not confirm where the two men were from.
</P>
<P>
She said the 49-year-old had been charged with conspiracy to shoot a person,
carrying a firearm with intent, possession of a firearm and ammunition without a
licence and conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm.
</P>
<P>
The 50-year-old has been charged with possessing arms and ammunition without a
licence.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who stepped down as a legislator last July, told reporters Saturday: "I was
never afraid because, as a Catholic, death to me is just like pushing the door
open to another life."
</P>
<P>
The plot was uncovered during the 2008 Legislative Council elections, one of the
limited voting opportunities in the city.
</P>
<P>
Universal suffrage was promised to Hong Kong when it was handed back to China by
colonial power Britain in 1997, but no timetable was set and democrats remain
frustrated at the slow pace of constitutional reform.
</P>
<P>
As well as his pro-democracy stance, Lee has been at the forefront of the
campaign to remember and vindicate pro-democracy activists who led a six-week
protest in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The 20th anniversary of the crackdown on the protests -- which left hundreds,
possibly thousands, dead across the Chinese capital -- will be marked on
Thursday in Hong Kong with a candlelight vigil expected to draw tens of
thousands.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, which has a separate legal system from China, has an outspoken and
vibrant political culture, but violence against politicians is rare.

Insein prison: Myanmar's 'silent killing field'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Bangkok, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Described by inmates as a "hell" where beatings are common and disease is rife,
Myanmar's Insein Prison, where Aung San Suu Kyi is on trial, is the brutal
symbol of the ruling junta's repression.
</P>
<P>
The Nobel laureate has spent the past three weeks incarcerated in a so-called
"guest house" at the jail on the outskirts of Yangon while her trial takes place
behind closed doors at the notorious compound.
</P>
<P>
Her party has expressed concerns for her health after she suffered leg cramps in
recent days while at the prison. The authorities say she is receiving medical
care.
</P>
<P>
But if Aung San Suu Kyi has been kept in relatively bearable conditions at the
prison -- which was built by former colonial power Britain -- for hundreds of
other political prisoners it is the heart of Myanmar's darkness.
</P>
<P>
"It's like a hell where people really suffer. It's some kind of silent 'killing
field,'" Bo Kyi, who spent seven years in the jail following a failed student
uprising in 1988, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Several political prisoners told of how they suffered bruising weeks-long
interrogations at the hands of the junta's jailers at Insein.
</P>
<P>
Bo Kyi said during one round of questioning he was whipped with a rubber cord as
he lay on his stomach and counted 150 lashes before he lost consciousness and
awoke in a solitary cell.
</P>
<P>
He said he was then forced to assume different positions for hour-long periods
while shackled in chains with a bar between his legs.
</P>
<P>
The heavily secured Insein is home to many of the 2,100 political prisoners
which the United Nations says are held in Myanmar's prisons, often on spurious
sentences of up to 60 years.
</P>
<P>
At least 139 political detainees have died in detention in the country since
1988, several of them in Insein, according to the Assistance Association for
Political Prisoners of Burma (AAPPB), co-founded by Bo Kyi.
</P>
<P>
Details of conditions inside the secretive jail emerge mostly from former
prisoners, although Tomas Okea Quintana, the UN Special Rapporteur on Myanmar,
visited the prison for four hours in February and met five inmates.
</P>
<P>
He said after his visit that many detainees suffered from a lack of medical care
during imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Former prisoner Aung Myo Naing, who spent more than eight years there, said that
each cell in Insein is 8 by 11 feet (2.5 by 3.5 metres), furnished with two
bamboo mats and two uncovered toilet buckets.
</P>
<P>
"Insein Prison is a deadly torture camp," the 41-year-old said, describing one
period of about 45 days when he was kept in solitary confinement and forbidden
to read, write or bathe.
</P>
<P>
Past prisoners have described novel methods of communicating during these times,
scratching messages to one another on cigarette filter papers and feeding them
through holes in prison walls.
</P>
<P>
Inmates are given 15 minutes outside of the cell daily to shower, but they have
no soap and no spare clothes to change into.
</P>
<P>
Many prisoners are starving -- their rations of food consist of boiled water
with a few sparse vegetables, fish paste and occasional rations of meat along
with overcooked rice, while water is not purified.
</P>
<P>
The conditions mean that diseases such as tuberculosis and hepatitis B are rife,
while joint pains, eyesight problems and mental illness are commonplace.
</P>
<P>
But access to a doctor is rare.
</P>
<P>
"They give you aspirins and another drug for sneezing, whatever illness you've
got," said Aung Myo Thein, whose elder brother was also imprisoned and now
suffers severe depression.
</P>
<P>
Due to dirty needles, medical treatment can itself be hazardous.
</P>
<P>
Last year media watchdog Reporters Without Borders said that poet Aung Than, a
member of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, was probably infected with
the HIV virus when he was forcibly injected in Insein prison hospital.
</P>
<P>
Many other prominent prisoners have been denied access to healthcare and have
been moved since October 2008 to jails hundreds of miles from their families.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross made its last visit to Insein
Prison in November 2005, and two months later suspended its prison visits saying
it could not fulfil its independent, impartial mandate.

Vietnam records first swine flu case: doctor
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hanoi, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 23-year-old Vietnamese man has tested positive for swine flu in what would be
the the first case in the Southeast Asian nation, a doctor said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An initial test conducted Saturday at the tropical diseases hospital in southern
Ho Chi Minh City was positive, Phan Van Tu, a doctor with the city's Pasteur
Institute, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
But he said the Pasteur Institute, which specialises in testing for infectious
diseases, would conduct another test on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The patient was in a stable condition with a slight fever, Tu added.
</P>
<P>
State-linked Tuoi Tre newspaper reported that the patient is a student recently
returned from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Tuoi Tre said he arrived in Ho Chi Minh City from the US Monday night and was
admitted to hospital there after being checked by health authorities.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, which did not give a source for its report, said the student
later left hospital to go home but on Friday went to the tropical diseases
hospital, where he tested positive for the A(H1N1) virus.
</P>
<P>
Swine flu was first detected last month in the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
In its latest update the World Health Organisation said 53 countries have
reported 15,510 cases of swine flu, including 99 deaths.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has been monitoring the health of passengers arriving at its airports in
a bid to detect swine flu.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month authorities in South Korea said a 22-year-old Vietnamese
woman returning home from the US was infected with A(H1N1) and placed in
quarantine while on a transit stop at Incheon.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has the world's second-highest death toll from bird flu, at 56.
</P>
<P>
Preventing swine flu from infecting patients sick with the deadly H5N1 avian flu
should be a top priority, especially in Asia, experts have said.

Japan's shadow finance minister wants single Asian currency
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
tokyo, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The man who hopes to be Japan's next finance minister envisions an Asia united
by a single currency, saying the dollar may no longer reign supreme in future.
</P>
<P>
The opposition's 'shadow finance minister' Masaharu Nakagawa also says he hopes
to reshape the world's number two economy into a kinder, gentler place if his
Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) wins elections this year.
</P>
<P>
"You can't invigorate society only through... the law of the jungle where the
strong become stronger," he told AFP. "The same player would always win if there
were no handicaps in golf."
</P>
<P>
Japan's conservative Prime Minister Taro Aso must call elections by September,
when the DPJ hopes to topple his Liberal Democratic Party, which has been in
power for almost all of the past half century.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with AFP, Nakagawa outlined some of the changes he would like to
make if he becomes finance minister in Asia's largest economy, which is now in
the throes of its worst post-World War II recession.
</P>
<P>
Looking at the broader region, he said Asia should tackle security and economic
issues as "a unified community."
</P>
<P>
"Asian currencies should be unified into a common currency in the course of the
region's forming a single economic zone," Nakagawa told AFP.
</P>
<P>
He did not give a timeframe, saying it would largely depend on economic and
political developments in China.
</P>
<P>
Nakagawa said people must "take into account the possibility that the dollar
might not function as the key currency any more in the medium and long term" as
the world seeks a new order in the post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
Until an Asian common currency emerges, he said, "the Japanese government should
make efforts to have the 'Asia zone' use the yen, not the dollar, for trade
settlements. It's time for Japan to launch this plan."
</P>
<P>
Japan's government could extend lending to the International Monetary Fund on
condition that it is in yen while guaranteeing bonds by Asian countries if they
are denominated in the Japanese currency, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nakagawa, who turns 59 in June, studied foreign affairs at Georgetown University
in the United States in the 1970s. The father-of-four represents a constituency
in central Mie prefecture.
</P>
<P>
He says he is a "generalist" rather than an economic expert.
</P>
<P>
Speaking more broadly on his vision for Japan, he said the country had followed
the United States and its liberalism in the past, but the time had come for the
nation to be "more Asian."
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time for Japan to say what kind of world it would like to create,
not to adapt itself to the given circumstances as it has done" since its defeat
in World World II, he said.
</P>
<P>
At home, Nakagawa's vision is in line with the goal of a "compassionate society"

Police probe Malaysian opposition members

KUALA LUMPUR, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Malaysian police are probing three opposition members for alleged sedition and
slander against the prime minister, amid allegations of a mounting crackdown on
dissent.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, police have raided the offices of one of the parties in the
Pakatan Rakyat opposition alliance, and arrested more than 160 people for
protesting against the government's takeover of northern Perak state.
</P>
<P>
In the latest move, police questioned the opposition trio, including two
lawmakers, over speeches made in the campaign for a by-election in the island
state of Penang on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"This is definitely another step towards creating a police state. It is clearly
an abuse of power," said Lim Kit Siang from the Democratic Action Party, who was
one of the lawmakers questioned by police.
</P>
<P>
"The Perak crisis is broadening into a national crisis of confidence where one
government institution after another is suffering from a credibility crisis as
they have been made to serve the premier's agenda," he said.
</P>
<P>
Perak has been in limbo since February when the state's sultan ordered the
Pakatan Rakyat to cede its control of the state, which it won in elections last
year, after defections disrupted the delicate balance of power.
</P>
<P>
Lim said he was investigated for his criticisms of Prime Minister Najib Razak
over the takeover while the two others were being investigated over that issue
as well as comments linking Najib to a sensational murder case.
</P>
<P>
The duo are from opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim's Keadilan party.
</P>
<P>
Najib has vehemently denied any involvement in the killing of 28-year-old
Mongolian woman Altantuya Shaariibuu, who was murdered in 2006 and whose remains
were blown up with military-grade explosives in a jungle clearing.
</P>
<P>
"I questioned in my speech why Najib does not take action against the foreign
media which linked him to the murder as a way to clear his name," Keadilan's
Badrul Hisham Shaharin told AFP.
</P>
<P>
State news agency Bernama quoted police officials Saturday as confirming the
trio are under investigation.

India economy headed higher, reforms in sight: analysts
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New Delhi, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
India's economy is on the upswing with eyes now keenly focused on July's planned
budget for new market-opening moves by the freshly re-elected Congress
government, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
The country logged unexpectedly strong 5.8 percent growth in the final quarter
to March 2009, against forecasts of 5.0 percent, figures late last week showed,
prompting analysts to say the economy had turned the corner.
</P>
<P>
"We see a new growth cycle taking shape with the first stop seven percent and
then eight percent," said Rajeev Malik, economist at Macquarie Securities.
</P>
<P>
India's economy expanded by 6.7 percent in the year to March 2009, down from
nine percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
But the country of nearly 1.2 billion people is performing far better than many
others caught in the global slump, thanks to its vast, resilient domestic
market, hefty government spending and aggressive rate cuts, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Foreign capital is pouring back into India with the benchmark Sensex share index
near a nine-month high of 14,625 following a spurt in May after the Congress
party was swept back to power with its biggest seat haul in 18 years.
</P>
<P>
The strong mandate allows the Congress to govern without the support of the
communists who propped up the government in parliament during its last term.
</P>
<P>
Economists called the Congress win a "game changer" for the economy because it
raises hopes of political stability for the next five years and the introduction
of economic reforms that had been blocked by the Left.
</P>
<P>
There has already been a flurry of announcements by new ministers promising such
moves as loosening state-controlled fuel pump prices, which would help refinery
profits, and cutting mobile call rates to propel India's explosively growing
cellular sector.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth is forecast at around six percent in the first half of the year
and closer to seven percent in the second amid "green shoots" signs such as
higher car sales and cement output.
</P>
<P>
Next year, economists expect expansion of eight percent.
</P>
<P>
"We expect a pick-up in economic activity from lower borrowing costs and higher
government spending which is feeding through the system," said Shubhada  Rao,
economist at Yes Bank.
</P>
<P>
In another positive sign, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and
Industry (FICCI) announced Saturday a sharp upturn in business optimism.
</P>
<P>
Some 57 percent of 300 firms polled in the final quarter to March declared
economic conditions were "moderately to substantially" better -- up from the
nine percent in the previous quarter who reported an improvement.
</P>
<P>
"Companies are looking forward to a recovery on the basis of their order books
and performance," FICCI economist Anjan Roy said.
</P>
<P>
Economists are now focused on the budget that Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee
has promised to present in the first week of July to see what steps he will take
to open up India's still relatively inward-looking economy.
</P>
<P>
Mukherjee said last week the government would press ahead with some long stymied
reforms "in the financial sector and real economy" to make it more competitive
and draw foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The government may privatise some state-owned firms and raise  foreign-ownership
caps in insurance and aviation as well as possibly broadening overseas
investment access in retailing.
</P>
<P>
But Mukherjee said his "top priority" was "reviving the growth momentum" and
helping the poor and he would step up spending even if this meant scant progress
in closing India's yawning fiscal deficit, which at 6.2 percent is at a seven-
year peak.
</P>
<P>
HSBC economist Robert Prior Wandesforde forecast no "big bang" reforms in a
country where economic changes can provoke huge debate.
</P>
<P>
But "even if they (the government) do a few things, the multiplier effect will
be quite significant," said Macquarie's Malik.

Foreign investors eye Angola
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Luanda, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the lobby bar of one of Luanda's few decent hotels, suited businessmen sit in
deep leather armchairs waiting for a meeting in the oil-rich country which could
change their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
"Angola is one of the last great emerging market opportunities," one European
man told AFP between sips of whisky.
</P>
<P>
"I don't care about the logistical problems as long as the solutions and rewards
are there -- I'm in this for the long term to make money."
</P>
<P>
Thanks to high oil prices and a peacetime construction frenzy, Angola has
enjoyed annual double-digit growth since a 27-year civil war ended in 2002 to
become one of the world's fastest growing economies.
</P>
<P>
Growth is set to slow this year, but interest from international investors has
not abated with a recent flurry of high profile trade delegations, all hoping to
get a piece of the action.
</P>
<P>
The government's response to falling commodity prices, which threaten public
spending aimed at Angola's poor majority, is diversification into areas such as
agriculture and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Angola's main foreign players have been Brazilian and Portuguese
firms, and Chinese companies helped along by close ties and credit lines
believed to exceed five billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
But along with visits from the United States, France and South Korea in the past
month, there have also been business forums in Rome and Cairo and state visits
by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos to Germany and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Last week a trade agreement was signed with US Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Among the recent American delegation was Delta Air Lines which hopes to launch
the first direct scheduled flight from the United States to Luanda in September.
</P>
<P>
"There's no question, Angola is a very strong market and there is a lot of
potential," the airline's government affairs advisor Scott Yohe told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"The amount of time it takes to get to Angola from the US, via Europe or via
South Africa, has an impact on trade and the new flight will definitely be a
catalyst for investment."
</P>
<P>
Dubai-based Emirates starts flying three times a week from Luanda to Dubai in
August.
</P>
<P>
"Angola is a country which is really moving," explained Nigel Page, senior vice
president of Emirates in Americas and Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We predict that there will be a lot of business exchanges between Luanda and
Dubai and this route will channel more companies into Angola from the east."
</P>
<P>
There is already plenty of Asian investment in Angola, particularly from China
which holds a number of key construction contracts, including four 2010 Africa
Cup of Nations football stadiums.
</P>
<P>
China's interest in Angola has aroused concern in the west, especially as a
number of the loans have been oil backed, but Alex Vines, of the London-based
think tank Chatham House, believes the Sino-Angolan relationship may be waning.
</P>
<P>
"From a geo-strategic point of view, Angola wants to woo lots of different
investment, not just from China," he told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"And that's why we've seen Dos Santos making these high profile visits to Europe
and these other trade trips being invited to Angola."
</P>
<P>
Despite predicting a three-percent contraction in 2009, World Bank economist
Ricardo Gazel said: "Angola's economy is still in a much better position than
most and medium and long term, the prospects are very good.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of investment interest, particularly in the non-petroleum sector
which is good for diversifying the economy and for the economy as a whole."
</P>
<P>
For businesses hoping to break into the Angolan market however, it's not easy
and good contacts go a long way.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's Doing Business Report ranks Angola as one of the hardest places
to set up a company with 68 days needed to start a business, although this has
halved since 2008.
</P>
<P>
But, big on capital if low on know-how, Angola has been spreading the word about
investment opportunities and it seems the world is listening.

Bordeaux bets on top quality but cheap 2008 vintage
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BORDEAUX, France, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After months of gloom, Bordeaux wine traders are hoping the 2008 vintage will
revive the market after steep price cuts and rave reviews from the world's most
influential connoisseur.
</P>
<P>
The southwestern French region's rarest wines are sold every spring as a futures
commodity, 12 months prior to bottling. With the world gripped by recession,
many had been fearing financial disaster.
</P>
<P>
The futures sale only concerns a tiny percentage of the 800 million bottles the
Bordeaux region produces annually, but the prices of the top 20 wines help
determine the public perception of the quality of the vintage.
</P>
<P>
This year, the big wine estates brought prices down sharply, opening the way for
traders to target middle market wine drinkers after a period when the finest
wines were priced for sale to only the richest speculators.
</P>
<P>
As Patrick Bernard, owner of wine merchant powerhouse Millesima, explained: "If
the top 20 wines double or triple their prices as they did in 2005, all of
Bordeaux wine is perceived as expensive.
</P>
<P>
"The first wine on the market was Angelus, one of those 20 wines, and they cut
their price by 40 percent. A few days later, the First Growths came out with a
45 percent decrease and then Yquem with a 65 percent decrease."
</P>
<P>
Other premium wines were released at the same time to maintain momentum.
Leoville Barton dropped its ex-cellar price to 23 euros and sold out within a
few hours.
</P>
<P>
"It was much better than I expected," said Lilian Barton, co-owner of the
legendary estates Chateaux Leoville Barton and Langoa Barton, and director of
her family wine merchant, Les Vins Fins Anthony Barton.
</P>
<P>
In addition to dropping their prices, the chateaux had hoped to demonstrate
their independence from US wine critic Robert Parker, nicknamed the "Million
Dollar Nose" for his influence on the market.
</P>
<P>
Parker is a champion of Bordeaux's wines, but many in the industry feel that he
wields too much power with his rankings, and three-quarters of the wines were
put on sale before he had given his verdict.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration of defiance was only partly successful, at best.
</P>
<P>
Several sources said that sales prior to the release of Parker's ratings, with
the exception of a few star buys, were subdued. The tempo changed when Parker
awarded the vintage spectacular ratings.
</P>
<P>
"The buyers went berserk," said Barton.
</P>
<P>
Clients who had pleaded poverty in early April suddenly found the wherewithal to
buy on futures.
</P>
<P>
Despite annoyance with the fickle importers, Barton, Anson, Bernard and others
were relieved to see the return of traditional customers who had been pushed out
of the market in recent years by skyrocketing prices.
</P>
<P>
The vintage was very good and there was a dramatic drop in price -- buyers are
stocking up for customers who buy wine to drink rather than to invest.
</P>
<P>
"This was the vintage to buy for the consumer," enthused Bernard.
</P>
<P>
Unlike nearly all of the other 400 wine merchants, Millesima, with annual
revenues of 52 million euros, sells directly to the consumer in 11 European
countries and America.
</P>
<P>
"Direct sales to European consumers has been good. There's no currency problem
and they haven't been able to afford it over the last few years."
</P>
<P>
Bernard will buy 35,000 cases this year, a 10 percent increase over last year
even though most chateaux are offering customers only 80 percent of their usual
allocations because of a small crop.
</P>
<P>
While the 2008 futures campaign is slowly drawing to a close, there is little
doubt that for many it succeeded in resuscitating not only sales but the image
of Bordeaux wine as a consumer product.
</P>
<P>
Already merchants and winegrowers are looking forward to Vinexpo, the
International Wine and Spirits Exhibition held from June 21 to 25, with 45,000
professionals expected to attend.

Eurozone interest rate locked, new steps on tap: analysts
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Frankfurt, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The main eurozone interest rate is probably locked in at 1.0 percent for now,
but credit flows remain weak and the European Central Bank will detail this week
new ways to get money flowing again.
</P>
<P>
The ECB will also release Thursday its latest staff forecasts for growth and
inflation in the 16-nation bloc, with a downward revision likely for the former
owing to a disastrous first quarter in its leading economies.
</P>
<P>
With interest rates most likely on hold for a while, "the focus has shifted to
any developments regarding unconventional policies," said Capital Economics
economist Jennifer McKeown.
</P>
<P>
The ECB has already said it will buy 60 billion euros' (85 billion dollars')
worth of covered, or collateralised, bonds, a move that should help restore cash
flows in French, German and Spanish markets where such instruments are traded
most widely.
</P>
<P>
Details are expected after a meeting of the bank's governing council.
</P>
<P>
But the amount corresponds to just 0.6 percent of the eurozone's gross domestic
product, McKeown noted, whereas bolder moves by the US Federal Reserve and Bank
of England are worth around 10 percent of their respective GDP.
</P>
<P>
It also remains to be seen whether the ECB will "sterilise" the purchases by
issuing its own debt or selling other assets, or whether it will just print new
money, a move that could fuel inflation.
</P>
<P>
The bank's priority is to keep inflation just below 2.0 percent, but it now
faces the prospect of a broad-based fall in prices that could end in a
deflationary spiral which could strangle economic activity.
</P>
<P>
If businesses and individuals become convinced that prices will fall further,
they postpone purchases, causing production to fall and raising unemployment,
which can depress prices further.
</P>
<P>
Eurozone inflation hit a record low of zero in May, European Union statistics
showed, and will likely turn negative in coming months owing to comparisons with
the same period last year when oil prices spiked to record highs.
</P>
<P>
But UniCredit economist Marco Valli said: "We don't think the ECB will be overly
impressed" by the development, which has been forecast for several months.
</P>
<P>
ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet has stressed that short term price volatility
is not a factor in the bank's decisions, and with oil prices on the rise again,
a deflationary episode is unlikely to last long.
</P>
<P>
"The recent strong rally in oil prices makes the inflation picture more
uncertain than just a couple of weeks ago," Valli said.
</P>
<P>
"The central bank will continue to see the risk of deflation as very low," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The ECB can also point to indications that the eurozone's first recession has
probably passed its trough even though the European Commission still expects the
economy to contract by 1.9 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
That leaves the thorny problem of credit growth, which according to the bank's
figures continued to slow sharply in April.
</P>
<P>
"There is no easing in the very tight credit conditions that are facing
companies and individuals," noted Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight.
</P>
<P>
"Tighter credit conditions are a serious handicap to recovery prospects in the
eurozone," he said, and raise pressure on the ECB "to take additional 'non-
standard' measures."
</P>
<P>
Commerzbank analyst Rainer Guntermann felt "the ECB has not yet closed the door
to more easing measures," but that an expansion of the already announced bond
purchases in June was unlikely.

Germany rescues Opel, for now
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
berlin, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Germany has ensured that Opel's tens of thousands of workers will still have a
job on Monday when its once-mighty US parent General Motors, as is expected,
makes history and files for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
But Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to support with taxpayers' money a
Kremlin-backed rescue may come back to haunt her, and could fail to prevent Opel
crashing and burning further down the road, experts say.
</P>
<P>
"All this seems to rest on a very fragile base. Let's say there is a 60 or 70
percent chance that it won't work," Juergen Pieper, an automotive analyst at
Metzler Bank, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
In a mammoth effort over recent months climaxing in a frenzy of activity last
week, the German government agreed in the early hours of Saturday morning to
back a takeover of Opel by a consortium formed around Canada's Magna.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, GM would keep 35 percent of the company and Opel's workers would
retain 10 percent. Magna, which makes auto parts, would hold a 20 percent stake
and state-owned Russian lender Sberbank 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
Government sources told AFP that Germany would act as guarantor for around three
billion euros (4.2 billion dollars) worth of loans, and the government would
also itself make an emergency loan of 1.5 billion euros to Opel.
</P>
<P>
Magna meanwhile, which until recently was relatively unknown outside the auto
industry, has pledged to cough up 300 million euros to keep the cash-starved
Opel alive in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian firm, which thrashed out an eleventh-hour agreement with GM
executives in a luxury Berlin hotel on Friday, has pledged to keep all Opel's
German factories open and limit job cuts there to around 2,500.
</P>
<P>
But across Europe as a whole, where GM employs some 50,000 people including
7,000 in Spain and 4,700 at Britain's Vauxhall, the picture may be less rosy
with Magna saying it plans to lay off one in five workers.
</P>
<P>
Last week Germany came under pressure from Britain and Belgium not to save
German jobs at the expense of workers elsewhere, and on Saturday Britain's
biggest trade union Unite voiced concern about the fate of Vauxhall workers.
</P>
<P>
It was also unclear whether Magna's intention to start making Opel cars at a
factory in Russia owned by precious metals tycoon Oleg Deripaska's GAZ automaker
would mean some production will be taken away from plants in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Russian involvement also raises eyebrows because it strengthens the already
strong business ties -- most notably in gas -- between Berlin and Moscow.
Critics say that these ties make Germany too soft on the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
For analysts, it was September's elections in Germany that helped win Merkel
over to Russian involvement.
</P>
<P>
"Money doesn't smell at election time," said Andrew Wilson at the European
Council of Foreign Relations think tank.
</P>
<P>
Magna and its Russian backers have their work cut out making the deal work, with
Opel part of a global automotive industry that was already facing huge
challenges even before the world economy hit the skids last year.
</P>
<P>
Frank Schwope, an analyst at Germany's NordLB bank, predicted that the Canadian-
Russian investors "will try everything, and then fail and Opel will be insolvent
in two or three years."
</P>
<P>
Magna also has very little experience making cars -- unlike Fiat, which also
wanted to snap up Opel but then got cold feet -- and the financial details of
the deal are unclear.

Coup leader says no deal on Mauritania poll delay
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
DAKAR, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
General Ould Abdel Aziz, who toppled Mauritania's government last year, said
that no deal was near on delaying a controversial election scheduled to be held
later this week.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Ould Abdel Aziz and the opposition have been holding talks with
international mediators in the Senegalese capital Dakar, with sources on
Saturday on saying an accord was close on resolving the political deadlock in
the northwest African country.
</P>
<P>
But Ould Abdel Aziz dismissed such talk.
</P>
<P>
"A group of criminals is spreading these rumours and lies because they recognise
their inevitable defeat at elections," he said at a campaign meeting on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ould Abdel Aziz often calls supporters of the main opposition parties criminals.
</P>
<P>
"We are not negotiating in Dakar with criminals and bandits but with the
international community to ensure democracy and move forward on the path of
change," he was quoted as saying by Mauritania's ANI news agency.
</P>
<P>
"The election is still planned for June 6," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ould Abdel Aziz quit the military in April to run for president, and is widely
expected to win if the vote goes ahead as he doesn't have serious contenders due
to the boycott by the main opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The intensive talks launched in Dakar on Thursday -- which include officials
from the United Nations, African Union, European Union and Arab League -- have
focused on postponing the election to allow the opposition to end its boycott
and participate in the vote.
</P>
<P>
Under a five-page draft accord seen by AFP have Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, who was
toppled in last August's coup, would formally resign as president after signing
a decree to usher in a transitional period under a temporary government of
national unity.
</P>
<P>
This government would update the electoral rolls and issue voting cards to the
electorate ahead of elections.
</P>
<P>
A general amnesty would be declared, including for politicians arrested by the
military in the wake of the coup and subsequently accused of corruption.

Death toll in China coal mine blast rises to 30: state media
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The death toll from a gas explosion at a coal mine in southwestern China rose to
30 with the discovery of the bodies of the last five missing miners, state media
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Another 59 miners were injured in the explosion Saturday morning that ripped
through the mine in the town of Anwen in the Chongqing region, the China News
Service said.
</P>
<P>
The report also said three people "responsible" for the blast had been taken
into custody, but gave no other details.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident was being investigated, it said.
</P>
<P>
China's coal mines are notoriously dangerous. Official figures show that more
than 3,200 workers died in collieries last year, but independent observers say
the actual figure could be much higher, as many accidents are covered up.

Progress in fighting lung cancer at specialist summit
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Orlando, Florida, May 30, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cancer specialists, gathered for an annual meeting, are reporting progress in
the fight against lung cancer, the most common and deadliest form of cancer, but
little progress in treating colorectal cancer.
</P>
<P>
Doctors and researchers at the 45th gathering of the American Society of
Clinical Oncology (ASCO) -- the world's main cancer conference -- on Saturday
learned of two studies showing progress in the battle against lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
The first study showed how the combination of two anti-cancer treatments
following standard chemotherapy can slow the advance of lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
Patients treated with a combination of Tarceva, sold by the Swiss drugmaker
Roche, and Avastin, a drug by Roche's Genentech unit, saw their cancer growth
slow more than a control group treated with Avastin.
</P>
<P>
More than 750 patients were randomized to receive Avastin and a placebo, or
Avastin and Tarceva. Those in the Tarceva group survived an average of 4.8
months before the cancer started growing again, compared to 3.7 months for the
control group, said Vincent Miller, the study's main author.
</P>
<P>
The numbers translated to a 29 percent reduced risk of disease progression for
patients who took a combination of Tarceva and Avastin.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first study to show that adding erlotinib (Tarceva) to maintenance
therapy with bevacizumab (Avastin) delays disease progression in patients who
have already received bevacizumab as part of their initial chemotherapy," said
Miller.
</P>
<P>
A second study with 663 patients with advance lung cancer were given the drug
Alimta, from US pharmaceutical Eli Lilly, which blocks cell growth.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results showed that patients who took the drug lived 26 percent
longer compared to a control group that took a placebo: 13.4 months against 10.6
months.
</P>
<P>
As in the first study, all the patients had already received four standard
chemotherapy sessions.
</P>
<P>
"This study will change the overall standard of care," said Chandra Belani, the
deputy director of the Penn State Cancer Institute, as she presented the
research.
</P>
<P>
"Maintenance therapy with Alimta (permetrexed) offers a new paradigm for
patients who have advanced lung cancer, because it has a low toxicity and can be
given on an ongoing basis over a prolonged period of time to extend patients'
lives," she said.
</P>
<P>
However there were few advances to report in the fight against colorectal
cancer, the fourth most common in the United States and the second deadliest
type of cancer.
</P>
<P>
Research on 2,710 patients with Phase Three colorectal cancer taking the drug
Avastine along with standard chemotherapy treatment showed no difference in the
survival rate or the recurrence of the tumor after three and a half years when
compared to those not taking the drug.
</P>
<P>
Another study conducted in Italy among 747 patients with advanced colorectal
cancer showed that the drug Eloxatine from the French firm Sanofi did not reduce
the size of the tumor when combined with standard treatment used ahead of cancer
surgery.

Malaysian Sikh family in new 'bodysnatching' case
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Malaysian Sikh family is demanding to be given the remains of their relative
who Islamic authorities say had converted to Islam, in the latest "body
snatching" case to hit the country.
</P>
<P>
The family's lawyer said that religious authorities insisted Mohan Singh, a 41
-year-old art director who died of a heart attack last Monday, had died a Muslim
-- a claim the family disputes.
</P>
<P>
His body has been kept at the mortuary of a government hospital in central
Selangor state which has refused to release the remains to the family, lawyer
Rajesh Kumar told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"When he died, he was a practising Sikh, he never told anybody and nobody knew
that he had converted to Islam, including family and close friends. His
identification card to date stated that he is still a non-Muslim," Kumar said.
</P>
<P>
"The family is very upset. All they want is to claim the body and cremate him
according to the Sikh rites," he added.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said that the Islamic authorities claimed Mohan, who had directed
some local films, had converted to Islam in 1992 and was seeking confirmation of
his conversion from an Islamic sharia court.
</P>
<P>
"Our contention is that at the time of his death, he was still practising
Sikhism and even when his mother died three years ago, he performed the last
rites for the mother according to the Sikh faith," said Kumar.
</P>
<P>
"He wouldn't be able to do so if he is a Muslim," he said.
</P>
<P>
Conversion rows, including "body-snatching" cases when Islamic authorities have
battled with relatives over the remains of people whose religion is disputed,
are common in Muslim-majority Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The tussles have raised allegations that the country of 27 million people is
being "Islamised" and that the rights of the ethnic Chinese and Indian
minorities are being eroded.

Fiji bans 'inciteful' Christian conference
</HEADLINE>

Suva, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Fiji military regime, in its latest crackdown, has targeted the most
influential religious group in the Pacific island nation, ordering the Methodist
Church to cancel its annual conference.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued by the military and police accused the church of trying
to bring instability to the country.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown follows information that "inciteful issues are going to be
discussed at the conference", police spokeswoman Ema Mua confirmed to the
FijiLive website.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Methodist Church could not hide its involvement in
politics and part of the agenda for the August conference focused on the current
political situation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a former Methodist Church president was detained after
delivering a sermon calling for peaceful protests to restore democracy to Fiji.
</P>
<P>
Reverend Manasa Lasaro has been at the forefront of opposition in the Methodist
Church to the 2006 coup in which military chief and self-appointed prime
minister Voreqe Bainimarama overthrew the elected government.
</P>
<P>
Bainimarama has since ruled out democratic elections before 2014.
</P>
<P>
The Methodist Church is the dominant denomination among the devout indigenous
Fijians, who make up 57 percent of the total population of around 840,000.

Key Tiananmen dissident still defiant, 20 years on
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former top Chinese Communist official Bao Tong was purged for supporting the
1989 pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, but he says his
frustrations with the system started decades before.
</P>
<P>
"China's people have wasted 60 years," Bao, now one of the country's top
political dissidents, told AFP recently -- before authorities moved him out of
Beijing to wait out Thursday's 20th anniversary of the deadly crackdown.
</P>
<P>
His harsh assessment of the history of the People's Republic of China, founded
in October 1949, is one few ordinary Chinese would dare to make.
</P>
<P>
But the 76-year-old Bao, once a top aide to former Chinese leader Zhao Ziyang,
is not your average citizen.
</P>
<P>
He has spent the past 20 years either in jail, under house arrest or facing
other restrictions in his small west Beijing flat, just one block from a major
road where protesters battled tanks and troops.
</P>
<P>
He sees no sign of political openness on the horizon and says Beijing's failure
to come clean on the events of June 3-4, 1989 and give justice to victims has
been a key factor stunting democratic development.
</P>
<P>
"It has had a seriously negative impact. It has made China a country with no
voice.... a country in which no one can demand fairness," he said in the
interview at his apartment.
</P>
<P>
"I am a sample on display," Bao says with a smirk, charging the government only
allows foreign journalists to interview him to give the impression of openness,
while preventing anything he says from being disseminated in China.
</P>
<P>
Bao was dragged down along with Zhao, who was ousted from his position as
general secretary of the Communist Party for sympathising with the student
protesters who had rallied for weeks.
</P>
<P>
Zhao had opposed the use of force against the demonstrators, but was overruled
by party hardliners. Hundreds, and possibly thousands, were killed in the army
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
Bao, who once directed a top Communist party political reform office, is still
lean and energetic.
</P>
<P>
He now spends much of his time doing interviews with or fielding calls from
foreign media on a phone whose ring tone is the Disney theme "It's a Small
World."
</P>
<P>
Bao said China's current leaders bear no blame for what happened in Tiananmen
Square -- and could earn great praise both at home and abroad on this
anniversary by being more forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
"They are still the nation's leaders and I hope they can openly tell the Chinese
people and the world what happened," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the party's unwillingness to admit any mistakes will prevent that and the
Chinese people are too intimidated to demand such honesty, he added.
</P>
<P>
Much of the blame lies with the rest of the world for refusing to push China to
heal the wounds, said Bao, adding that other countries were increasingly
hesitant to rile China due to its growing economic and diplomatic clout.
</P>
<P>
"Not wanting to offend China means they cannot help China, cannot help China's
people attain their own rights, and cannot help the world community gain a
reliable, stable, peaceful member," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a good thing."
</P>
<P>
As the Communist Party gears up to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, Bao said there was
little to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
The party wasted a lifetime with collectivisation of the economy launched in
1953, only to come full circle with today's run-away capitalism.
</P>
<P>
"(We) have come back to the original point. The work of 1.3 billion people has
been wasted for 56 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a crime greater than (the Tiananmen crackdown)."
</P>
<P>
Bao expressed delight with the May release in English of Zhao's memoirs, put
together from secret tape recordings the deposed leader made while under house
arrest. His son, Bao Pu, is publishing the Chinese version of the book.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped the book, likely to be banned in China, could somehow be
distributed in the country and spark debate.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted the ghosts of Tiananmen would not likely be laid to rest any
time soon due to the nature of a government for which he wishes he had never
worked.
</P>
<P>
"I regret that I only realised all of this 20 years ago. Why couldn't I have
realised it 40 years ago or 60 years ago?" he lamented.

Tennis: Aussie star Philippoussis falls on tough times
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SYDNEY, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Australia's two-time Grand Slam finalist Mark Philippoussis has revealed his
tennis fortune is gone, he faces a legal battle to keep his home and has
suffered bouts of depression, reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis, 32, who earned more than seven million US dollars on the court
and millions more off it in endorsements, said he is being sued for failing to
pay the mortgage on his re-financed home in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Once ranked eighth in the world, Philippoussis said he had been unable to play
for three years after several operations on his knee, which ended his ATP Tour
playing career.
</P>
<P>
"I bought this house when I was 18, primarily for my mum. But I'm now paying
three-and-a-half times as much as I'd be paying on a normal home loan," he told
Melbourne's Sunday Herald Sun newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"Things are tough. Financially tough, but more importantly than that, it's been
the mental side.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say I'm battling depression, but have I been depressed a lot in the
past two years? And freaked out about a lot of things? The answer is yes."
</P>
<P>
"I haven't played tennis since 2006, and tennis is one of those sports where if
you don't play, you don't get paid," he added.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis, who inspired Australia to two Davis Cup final victories, over
France in 1999 and Spain in 2003, reflected on his fallen status as a one-time
tennis celebrity.
</P>
<P>
"I've lived an easy life, the life you dream about. And at that time I thought
it was normal, but it's so far from normal," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Money came in left, right and centre; you just thought that's how it was for
everyone and that's how it will always be."
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis said he was looking to play in tennis legends events with former
stars like John McEnroe, Jim Courier and Pat Cash.
</P>
<P>
"I've just got to take it on the chin and deal with it. It's the toughest time
of my life right now, but it's also the best time because I've woken up to so
many things in my life," he said.
</P>
<P>
"When I get back up from this I'll appreciate so many things so much more. I've
fallen down and I'll get back up."

Tiananmen: Six weeks of protests, and then a crackdown
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In April 1989, young Chinese with dreams of democracy staged an unprecedented
wave of protests after the death of former Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang, a
popular reformer.
</P>
<P>
The Tiananmen movement lasted six weeks before being violently quashed by the
army, leaving hundreds, and possibly thousands, dead.
</P>
<P>
Here is a timeline of the main events:
</P>
<P>
April 1989
</P>
<P>
- 15: Death of Hu Yaobang, who had been dismissed two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
- 17: First student protest on Tiananmen Square, to lay a wreath in honour of
Hu, adorned with pro-democracy slogans.
</P>
<P>
- 18: The students issue a list of demands to the government that includes
freedom of speech and democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
- 22: Hu's official funeral takes place at the Great Hall of the People on
Tiananmen Square, where 200,000 students are gathered.
</P>
<P>
- 25: Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader, says the protest movement seeks to
topple the Communist Party -- a claim that forms the basis of an explosive
editorial in the official People's Daily newspaper the next day.
</P>
<P>
- 27: Huge student demonstrations take place in Beijing, and protests erupt
across the country, including in towns that had been calm until that time.
</P>
<P>
May
</P>
<P>
- 4: The anniversary of the patriotic movement of May 4, 1919 triggers a new
mass demonstration in Beijing and in 50 other towns. The head of the Communist
Party, Zhao Ziyang, urges dialogue.
</P>
<P>
- 13: Students launch the occupation of Tiananmen Square and a hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
- 15: A historic visit by then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev for the
normalisation of Sino-Soviet ties is completely disrupted.
</P>
<P>
- 17: About 1.2 million students, workers, civil servants, and intellectuals
protest in Beijing. Major demonstrations take place in most provinces across the
country.
</P>
<P>
- 18: The conservative Prime Minister Li Peng attempts to start a dialogue with
student leaders.
</P>
<P>
- 19: Zhao goes to Tiananmen Square, and pleads with the hunger strikers to
leave, with tears in his eyes. It is his last public appearance.
</P>
<P>
- 20: Martial law is declared, and army troops that are summoned either stop or
are stopped by barricades.
</P>
<P>
- 26: Zhao is purged from the Communist leadership, and put under house arrest
on the 28th.
</P>
<P>
- 29: Fine arts students erect a statue -- the 'Goddess of Democracy' -- in
front of the portrait of Mao Zedong, the founder of communist China, on the
square, where students are growing tired and divided.
</P>
<P>
June:
</P>
<P>
- 1st: An official report brings up for the first time the notion of a "counter-
revolutionary riot."
</P>
<P>
- 2: The Communist Party's leadership decides to clear the square.
</P>
<P>
- 3: Students and citizens block military vehicles at Beijing's major
intersections. That night, messages broadcast by loudspeaker call on the
population to clear the roads. The students equip themselves with sticks and
makeshift weapons.
</P>
<P>
- June 3-4: The army evacuates Tiananmen Square without firing shots. Soldiers
flanked by tanks open fire elsewhere. Fighting on roads ensues. Hundreds, and
possibly thousands, are killed.
</P>
<P>
- 5-20: China is widely condemned abroad and is targeted with sanctions.
</P>
<P>
- 24: Jiang Zemin, the future Chinese president, is officially made General
Secretary of the Communist Party, replacing Zhao.

</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In April 1989, young Chinese with dreams of democracy staged an unprecedented
wave of protests after the death of former Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang, a
popular reformer.
</P>
<P>
The Tiananmen movement lasted six weeks before being violently quashed by the
army, leaving hundreds, and possibly thousands, dead.
</P>
<P>
Here is a timeline of the main events:
</P>
<P>
April 1989
</P>
<P>
- 15: Death of Hu Yaobang, who had been dismissed two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
- 17: First student protest on Tiananmen Square, to lay a wreath in honour of
Hu, adorned with pro-democracy slogans.
</P>
<P>
- 18: The students issue a list of demands to the government that includes
freedom of speech and democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
- 22: Hu's official funeral takes place at the Great Hall of the People on
Tiananmen Square, where 200,000 students are gathered.
</P>
<P>
- 25: Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader, says the protest movement seeks to
topple the Communist Party -- a claim that forms the basis of an explosive
editorial in the official People's Daily newspaper the next day.
</P>
<P>
- 27: Huge student demonstrations take place in Beijing, and protests erupt
across the country, including in towns that had been calm until that time.
</P>
<P>
May
</P>
<P>
- 4: The anniversary of the patriotic movement of May 4, 1919 triggers a new
mass demonstration in Beijing and in 50 other towns. The head of the Communist
Party, Zhao Ziyang, urges dialogue.
</P>
<P>
- 13: Students launch the occupation of Tiananmen Square and a hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
- 15: A historic visit by then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev for the
normalisation of Sino-Soviet ties is completely disrupted.
</P>
<P>
- 17: About 1.2 million students, workers, civil servants, and intellectuals
protest in Beijing. Major demonstrations take place in most provinces across the
country.
</P>
<P>
- 18: The conservative Prime Minister Li Peng attempts to start a dialogue with
student leaders.
</P>
<P>
- 19: Zhao goes to Tiananmen Square, and pleads with the hunger strikers to
leave, with tears in his eyes. It is his last public appearance.
</P>
<P>
- 20: Martial law is declared, and army troops that are summoned either stop or
are stopped by barricades.
</P>
<P>
- 26: Zhao is purged from the Communist leadership, and put under house arrest
on the 28th.
</P>
<P>
- 29: Fine arts students erect a statue -- the 'Goddess of Democracy' -- in
front of the portrait of Mao Zedong, the founder of communist China, on the
square, where students are growing tired and divided.
</P>
<P>
June:
</P>
<P>
- 1st: An official report brings up for the first time the notion of a "counter-
revolutionary riot."
</P>
<P>
- 2: The Communist Party's leadership decides to clear the square.
</P>
<P>
- 3: Students and citizens block military vehicles at Beijing's major
intersections. That night, messages broadcast by loudspeaker call on the
population to clear the roads. The students equip themselves with sticks and
makeshift weapons.
</P>
<P>
- June 3-4: The army evacuates Tiananmen Square without firing shots. Soldiers
flanked by tanks open fire elsewhere. Fighting on roads ensues. Hundreds, and
possibly thousands, are killed.
</P>
<P>
- 5-20: China is widely condemned abroad and is targeted with sanctions.
</P>
<P>
- 24: Jiang Zemin, the future Chinese president, is officially made General
Secretary of the Communist Party, replacing Zhao.

Tiananmen Square: 10 key figures
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
beijing, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following are brief profiles of the 10 people -- students, politicians and
others -- who played key roles in the drama that unfolded in Beijing's Tiananmen
Square in 1989:
</P>
<P>
THE STUDENTS
</P>
<P>
-- Wang Dan, the moderate (born 1969). A student from the elite Peking
University, he was replaced as leader of the movement by more radical
protesters. After his arrest in July 1989, he was sentenced in 1991 to four
years in jail. He was released in 1993, but arrested again in 1995 on subversion
charges and sentenced to another 11 years in prison. In 1998, he was deported to
the United States. He continues his campaign for democracy in China in the west.
</P>
<P>
-- Chai Ling, the muse (born 1966). The tiny woman was known as the "general
commander" of the protest headquarters at Tiananmen Square. After the crackdown,
she was put on the list of the 21 most wanted students, but after 10 months on
the run she managed to escape to France. She now lives in the United States,
where she works as an Internet entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
-- Wu'er Kaixi, the rebel (born 1968). A member of the Uighur ethnic minority,
he became a celebrity overnight after he interrupted Premier Li Peng during a
meeting between student leaders and politicians aired live on state television
on May 18, 1989. He was able to flee China after the June 4 crackdown and now
lives in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
THE POLITICIANS
</P>
<P>
-- Deng Xiaoping, the patriarch (1904-1997). The most influential of the
leaders, the chairman of the Central Military Commission and father of economic
reform tilted the balance in favour of a hard line and ordered the army to fire
on protesters after six weeks of rallies that left the government paralysed.
</P>
<P>
-- Zhao Ziyang, the disgraced reformer (1919-2005). As general secretary of the
Communist Party, he supported dialogue between the government and the
protesters. On May 19, 1989, he visited the students on Tiananmen Square, and,
in tears, urged them to leave. This was his last public appearance. He was
relieved of his duties in June and placed under house arrest until his death.
</P>
<P>
-- Li Peng, the hardliner (born 1928). He was made prime minister in 1988 and
also a member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party's Politburo, the
heart of political power in China. Announcing martial law on May 19, he paved
the way for the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
THE INTELLECTUALS
</P>
<P>
-- Fang Lizhi, the veteran dissident (born 1936). Even if this famous
astrophysicist did not participate directly in the Tiananmen movement, his ideas
were a clear inspiration. He had been thrown out of the Communist Party in 1987,
and shortly after the crackdown in 1989, the authorities issued an arrest order
against him. He escaped into the US embassy, and was granted political asylum in
the United States in 1991.
</P>
<P>
-- Liu Xiaobo, the mediator (born 1955). The author was popular among the young
for his criticism of traditional Chinese values, and further joined the students
in a hunger strike on Tiananmen Square. On the night of June 3 and into the
early hours of June 4, as the army proceeded to clear the square, he attempted
to negotiate an orderly evacuation. He was later arrested and spent a year and a
half in jail without ever being formally sentenced.
</P>
<P>
THE ARTIST
</P>
<P>
-- Cui Jian, the rocker (born 1961). The "father of rock" in China appeared
several times on Tiananmen Square in 1989, and one of his works, "Nothing to My
Name", became the unofficial fight song of the student movement.
</P>
<P>
THE UNKNOWN HERO
</P>
<P>
-- On June 5, the day after the crackdown, a young man placed himself in front
of a column of tanks, preventing it from passing down the Avenue of Heavenly
Peace in the heart of Beijing. At one point he even mounted the front tank to
appeal to its crew, but bystanders eventually dragged him away. Photos and
footage of the "Tank Man" immediately made top news around the world, and he
went down in history as a symbol of peaceful and unarmed protesters confronting
military repression. His name remains unknown to this day.

China faces dark memory of Tiananmen

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities in China are bracing for the 20th anniversary of the deadly June 4
crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square, a pivotal moment that
still haunts the nation.
</P>
<P>
The way the government will likely mark the sensitive date on Thursday -- with
deafening silence -- shows it is keenly aware of the emotional scars that remain
after the army ended six weeks of peaceful rallies in central Beijing.
</P>
<P>
China's Communist leaders have made any discussion of the brutal quelling of the
student-led demonstrations -- in which hundreds, maybe thousands, were killed --
taboo, but dissidents say the public could yet hold them accountable.
</P>
<P>
"People remember this date because they want the Communist Party to take
responsibility for the crimes it committed," said 53-year-old Qi Zhiyong, who
lost a leg after being shot by troops near Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
"It reminds them the party will resort to unbridled violence whenever it feels
threatened."
</P>
<P>
In a bid not to rankle the wary authorities, the main public commemoration
planned for Thursday will probably be silent.
</P>
<P>
Activist groups have called on citizens simply to wear white -- the traditional
colour of mourning -- to honour those killed in the mayhem that erupted when
tanks and troops rolled in to crush the protests.
</P>
<P>
The year 1989 was a disastrous one for communism across the globe and in China
the ruling party found itself in a struggle with democracy activists who
challenged its authoritarian rule over the world's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
The Tiananmen movement began in mid-April, when public grief over the death of
former party leader and popular reformer Hu Yaobang gradually morphed into bold
calls from students for political reform and steps to combat corruption.
</P>
<P>
Young students started to occupy Tiananmen Square, the symbolic centre of
political power in China. A sense of euphoria saturated the plaza as they took
part in rallies no one would have thought possible just weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
"There were banners everywhere. This was the first unauthorised political
demonstration in the (history of the) People's Republic of China," recalled one
of the student leaders, Wang Dan.
</P>
<P>
Calls for democracy and freedom filled the square, thousands went on hunger
strike, and one charismatic activist, Wu'er Kaixi, brazenly challenged Premier
Li Peng during a meeting broadcast live on state television.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the whole world was watching, as news crews from around the globe
gathered in Beijing to cover the historic visit by then Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, only to stumble upon an event that would be far more significant.
</P>
<P>
In the corridors of power, the protests drove a wedge between hardline leaders
led by Premier Li and moderates headed by Communist Party general secretary Zhao
Ziyang.
</P>
<P>
The hardliners won, with patriarch Deng Xiaoping, China's most powerful man,
tilting the balance in their favour. Zhao was removed from his post as party
leader and spent 16 years under house arrest until his death in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The student movement was declared a "counterrevolutionary rebellion", and
soldiers of the People's Liberation Army descended on the capital, crushing the
democratic dreams of an entire generation.
</P>
<P>
The number of people killed in the night of June 3-4 remains a mystery. China's
official death toll is 241, including 36 students. Dissidents say thousands may
have died.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown set off a wave of condemnation across the globe, and for several
years China was treated as a near-pariah, as Western governments offered asylum
to student leaders fleeing into exile.
</P>
<P>
The international community has long since welcomed China back into the fold,
and Beijing's communist leaders have cemented their hold on power, transforming
the country into the world's number three economy.
</P>
<P>
But they have shown no willingness to change their position that the protests
threatened Communist Party rule and had to be quelled in order to maintain
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have proven that the socialist road with Chinese characteristics that we
pursue is in the fundamental interests of our people," foreign ministry
spokesman Ma Zhaoxu told journalists in May.
</P>
<P>
But, undeterred, victims of the crackdown have called for renewed international
pressure on Beijing to reverse the official verdict on the quelling, saying
failure to stand up to a rising China tacitly abets the repression.
</P>
<P>
"So far, the international community... has adopted a policy of appeasement
towards the Chinese government," said Ding Zilin, 72, whose teenage son was shot
dead by the army.
</P>
<P>
Bao Tong -- a former aide to Zhao who was jailed for seven years following the
crackdown -- said the world has failed to push China to be more open about the
events of Tiananmen because of Beijing's increasing global clout.
</P>
<P>
"Not wanting to offend China means they cannot help China, cannot help China's
people attain their own rights, and cannot help the world community gain a
reliable, stable, peaceful member," Bao told AFP recently.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a good thing," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bao has since been ordered to sit out the anniversary at a resort more than
1,000 kilometres (625 miles) from Beijing -- evidence that the authorities in
the capital are not yet ready to reopen the Tiananmen wounds.

US urges rejection of Guantanamo Uighurs case
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
US NAVAL BASE AT GUANTANAMO BAY, Cuba, May 30, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Barack Obama's administration has asked the Supreme Court to reject a
request by Chinese Uighurs held at the Guantanamo Bay prison and cleared of all
charges to be released on US soil.
</P>
<P>
The petitioners "have already obtained relief. They are no longer being detained
as enemy combatants," wrote US Solicitor General Elena Kagan in the
administration's filing to the Supreme Court Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kagan wrote that the men, members of a Turkic-speaking Muslim minority who fear
persecution if returned to China, "are being housed in relatively unrestricted
conditions given the status of Guantanamo Bay as a United States military base."
</P>
<P>
Four years ago US authorities cleared the 17 imprisoned Uighurs, but they are
stuck at the Guantanamo prison due to fears that Beijing would torture them if
they returned to their homeland in northwestern China's remote Xinjiang
province.
</P>
<P>
At the prison, the Uighurs are held at "Camp Iguana," a special area for
detainees cleared for release. They have more freedom and greater privileges
than most other prisoners, including a recreational space and a library,
according to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
In October 2008 a federal judge ordered that the Uighurs be released in the
United States. The most likely place for the detainees to be released would be
in Washington's suburbs in northern Virginia, which is home to a significant
Uighur expatriate community.
</P>
<P>
A federal appeals court in February however overturned that ruling. It is the
Uighurs' appeal to that decision that the Supreme Court must now address.
</P>
<P>
But for the Obama administration, which is repeating some of the reasoning that
his predecessor George W. Bush used, "the decision whether to allow aliens
abroad to enter the United States and if so, under what terms, rests exclusively
in the political branches," according to the filing, which AFP obtained a copy.
</P>
<P>
For the government, the "petitioners' continued presence at Guantanamo Bay is
not unlawful detention but rather the consequence of their lawful exclusion from
the United States under the constitutional exercise of authority by the
political branches, coupled with the unavailability of another country willing
to accept them," Kagan wrote.
</P>
<P>
The nine justices sitting on the US high court have not yet said whether they
would examine the politically explosive case, and could announce a decision by
June.
</P>
<P>
The legal case was filed by 14 of the 17 Uighur prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The Guantanamo camp was established by the Bush administration as an offshore
prison for "war on terror" detainees. Some 800 youth and adults have passed
through the prison camp and about 240 remain today.
</P>
<P>
The US navy established a base in Guantanamo Bay at the end of the 1898 Spanish-
American War, then signed a long-term lease with the Cuban government. Cuba's
communist government has been demanding its return since the 1960s.

Blockbuster videogame line-up to spark E3 magic
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
San Francisco, May 30, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Videogame makers are defying horrid economic times with an annual Electronic
Entertainment Expo (E3) brimming with blockbuster titles and unbridled pizzazz.
</P>
<P>
The expo kicking off Tuesday in Los Angeles is expected to revive dazzle of
years past and offer previews of hot videogames that will hit the market for the
prime year-end holiday shopping season.
</P>
<P>
"We are starting to see an industry waking up to the fact that we've been out of
the limelight," said Scott Steinberg, publisher of DigitalTrends.com, a game and
gadget website with 40 million readers.
</P>
<P>
"E3 is the public face of the industry. You will see all sorts of surprises. At
this point, it is anyone's game."
</P>
<P>
Videogame sales grew through much of the financial crisis, but slid in March and
April of this year, according to industry figures.
</P>
<P>
Analysts remain optimistic about videogames, citing surveys indicating players
would rather cut back on other entertainment, such as movies or dining out.
</P>
<P>
Major videogame makers are playing it safe by rolling out sequels to hit
franchises and freshening faded successes.
</P>
<P>
French videogame star Ubisoft will show off "Assassins Creed 2" and "Red Steel
2" along with the latest in a line of popular "Rabbids" titles featuring zany
animated rabbits.
</P>
<P>
Ubisoft will also unveil videogames made from television game shows "Family
Feud," "The Price Is Right" and "Press Your Luck" tailored for Nintendo's Wii
consoles.
</P>
<P>
"(These) are some of the most popular game shows of all time," said Ubisoft
senior vice president of sales and marketing Tony Key."
</P>
<P>
"These video games will appeal to all generations and make a great addition to
family game night."
</P>
<P>
Eagerly-anticipated sequels to be touted at E3 include "Mass Effect 2,"
"Bioshock 2," "God of War 3," and a "Modern Warfare" title likely to be a
powerhouse in the "Call of Duty" franchise."
</P>
<P>
"What we are seeing is a shift toward higher quality, risk-averse publishing,"
Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, if you are going to ask someone to pony-up 60 bucks for a title,
even though you can argue they get 30 hours of game play, it has to be good."
</P>
<P>
Videogame makers are expected to continue a trend toward downloadable content
(DLC) for titles as well as letting people play on the Internet as teammates or
opponents.
</P>
<P>
"Online is a feature everyone is trying to exploit," said videogame analyst Mike
Hickey of Janco Partners.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft Xbox, Sony PlayStation3, and Wii each offer arenas for online play.
</P>
<P>
"Publishers love it because they can capture an audience for a longer time,
delay trade-ins and hold up pricing; then there is always the idea of micro
transactions for downloadable content."
</P>
<P>
The makers of controversial but hot-selling "Grand Theft Auto" are to provide a
look at DLC titled "The Ballad of Gay Tony." Bethesda Softworks will expand on
DLC for its winning "Fallout 3" videogame.
</P>
<P>
Bethesda will also debut a "Brink" videogame that "does some really cool and
innovative things for a shooter," according to studio marketing director Pete
Hines.
</P>
<P>
Pressure is on Nintendo to deliver captivating titles for the Wii, which has
been a sales sensation but could lose momentum in the absence of must-have new
videogames to play on the consoles.
</P>
<P>
"Nintendo needs something; everyone is saying that," Hickey said.
</P>
<P>
A MotionPlus gadget that makes Wii motion-sensing remote controls more precise
is to hit the market during E3, and videogame giant Electronic Arts will preview
athlete-themed golf and tennis titles that work with the gizmos.
</P>
<P>
Sword action in Ubisoft's "Red Steel" is also tailored for MotionPlus.
</P>
<P>
The popularity of music-based videogames continues, with Harmonix and MTV
rolling out a "Rock Band" title that "takes players on a journey through the
legacy and evolution" of The Beatles.
</P>
<P>
Activision is to offer a glimpse of "DJ Hero," a "Guitar Hero" style videogame
in which the virtual instruments are turntables.
</P>
<P>
Analysts are watching for price cuts or new videogame hardware. Sony is expected
to introduce a next-generation PSP handheld videogame device to compete with
Nintendo's freshly-launched DSi model.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft and Sony might ramp-up motion-sensing abilities of console controllers
in the spirit of Wii.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to see a little of the magic come back to E3," Steinberg said.
"Games that really push the boundaries for high-definition audio/visual and
really stretch."

Ubisoft's madcap 'Rabbids' breeding US fans
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
San Francisco, May 30, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
French videogame titan Ubisoft is turning E3 into a playground for "Rabbids,"
madcap videogame rabbits breeding fans throughout Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
A team of Rabbids, accompanied by a street band from Romania, will "wreak havoc"
outside an annual Electronic Entertainment Expo videogame industry extravaganza
that begins Tuesday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
E3 attendees will be invited to hurl t-shirts and other tchotchkes given away at
the event into a colossal faux toilet.
</P>
<P>
Rabbids will heap offerings on a trash mountain of items that will be donated to
charity or recycled after E3 concludes on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The stunt is intended as levity as well as an unmasked promotion of an Ubisoft
"Rabbids Go Home" videogame making an E3 debut.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian band's music is featured in the fourth installment of an
increasingly popular videogame franchise.
</P>
<P>
"Go Home" play centers of getting the wacky animated characters to snatch all
the "human stuff" they can find and pile it high enough to reach the moon.
</P>
<P>
"They are like spoiled four-year-olds; distracted by everything," said Ubisoft
game producer Adrian Lacey of the Rabbids team in southern France.
</P>
<P>
"They are the child in everyone; the rebellious creature that does all the
things we don't dare do but would like to."
</P>
<P>
The Rabbid weapon of choice is a bathroom plunger, and antics in games includes
cow hurling; pumping carrot juice into mouths, and demolishing portions of Paris
by belching.
</P>
<P>
Lacey notes that "Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party" was the first videogame to let
players control action with their butts.
</P>
<P>
Players sitting on Wii console balance boards lean and shift to steer Rabbits in
a downhill sleigh race.
</P>
<P>
"What is true about the Rabbids is there are no regulations; go crazy and have
fun with them," Lacey said. "He has an edgy humor."
</P>
<P>
The Rabbids franchise was launched in 2006, with each subsequent version
outselling its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
Ubisoft has sold more than six million Rabbids videogames, with one million of
those sales in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We've seen the appeal just grow and grow," Lacey said. "We are not at the point
where we are a 'Super Mario' yet, but it would be nice to get there."
</P>
<P>
Lacey laughingly equates the look of a Rabbid to "a sack of potatoes on two
stumpy legs" and credits their unintelligible language to a team member prone to
annoying people with strange sounds.
</P>
<P>
"He never looks ridiculous because he is," Lacey said of each Rabbid. "It is one
of those funny things."
</P>
<P>
The Rabbids appeal prompted French car maker Renault to feature the characters
in advertising and Kraft to use them to promote Capri Sun brand drinks.
</P>
<P>
"We're always looking for inventive ways to keep the brand cool and relevant
with our audience," said Capri Sun senior brand manager Vinay Sharma.
</P>
<P>
Rabbid fever has resulted in toys and figurines based on the characters.
</P>
<P>
"They should take over the world," Lacey quipped. "If I keep losing hair, I may
turn into a Rabbid."

Clinton faces possible Cuba 'minefield' on trip south
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON, May 30, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton risks walking into what one analyst calls
a Latin American minefield over ties with Cuba when she visits El Salvador and
neighboring Honduras this week.
</P>
<P>
The issue will hover over Monday's inauguration of new Salvadoran president
Mauricio Funes in San Salvador and could cause a rift at the Organization of
American States (OAS) general assembly in San Pedro Sula, Honduras on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
US officials could not even rule out the possibility of Clinton's skipping the
OAS meeting altogether if negotiators fail to agree on terms for bringing Cuba
back within the 35-member organization's fold.
</P>
<P>
The United States wants Cuba to free political prisoners and respect political
freedoms for it to participate fully in the OAS, saying it is holding the body
to the democratic principles enshrined in its own 2001 charter.
</P>
<P>
Other OAS members say that Cuba can be nudged toward democracy once inside the
OAS.
</P>
<P>
Many members point out that the reason for Cuba's suspension in 1962 -- its role
in the Cold War-era Soviet bloc -- does not apply today as the bloc no longer
exists.
</P>
<P>
Even though Cuba itself rejects the OAS, analysts said, many countries want to
use the issue to either push for a lifting of the decades-old US embargo on
Havana or for their own private agendas, such as to embarrass the United States.
</P>
<P>
Since a popular US President Barack Obama took office in January, he has raised
hopes among many of his southern neighbors that he will soon lift the embargo,
even if he insists that Cuba first undertake democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a complicated challenge for her (Clinton) to deal with,"
said Michael Shifter, an analyst for the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington
think tank.
</P>
<P>
"I sense the Obama people are a little bit nervous. I think they're aware that
it's a minefield, Cuba," said Shifter who pointed to the risk of a rift within
the OAS.
</P>
<P>
And Clinton's stop in San Salvador "creates a certain dynamic," Shifter said,
because the presence of a Cuban leader at the inauguration will mark the start
of El Salvador's own moves toward full diplomatic ties with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
It will expose the US position even more because, under the previous US-backed
right-wing government, El Salvador was the last Latin American countries not to
have normal relations with Cuba, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shifter said he has heard that Cuban President Raul Castro is attending, but AFP
was unable to confirm the information.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Clinton would meet with the Cubans at the inauguration, a senior US
official said on the condition of anonymity: "We're not at the stage right now
where the secretary would meet with Cuban officials."
</P>
<P>
Shifter said the OAS secretary general, Jose Miguel Insulza, as well as radical
leftist Venezuela, Nicaragua and host country Honduras were driving the agenda
to have Cuba readmitted to the OAS.
</P>
<P>
Instead of having Cuba as the burning issue, he said, the Obama team would have
preferred to highlight a new era of US cooperation with leftist but pragmatic
democratic governments like those in El Salvador, Brazil and Chile.
</P>
<P>
Her visit to San Salvador is symbolic of the shift because Funes brought to
power the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation, former leftist
guerrillas who fought the US-backed right-wing government in the 1980s civil
war.
</P>
<P>
Chris Sabatini, an analyst with the Council of Americas, said the new
administration is trying to show that the "tent of democracy is broad" even
while a few leftist radicals remain in the region.
</P>
<P>
"It is an attempt to not so much isolate them (radicals) but to create a
positive pole in the hemisphere of democrats that can't be easily labeled as
just pro-US, but range across the ideological spectrum," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sabatini also expected the consensus-driven OAS to come to some agreement on the
Cuba issue, saying the current debate amounted to a "tempest in a teapot" and a
distraction to important human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
On rare occasions, the OAS can vote on an issue, however.
</P>
<P>
A senior US State Department official told reporters late Friday "it's hard to
say" when asked if a consensus would be reached.
</P>
<P>
Nor could he exclude the possibility that Clinton might have to skip the
meeting. "I can't answer that question," he said.
</P>
<P>
Spokespeople at the OAS headquarters told AFP on Saturday that no resolution had
been reached and that the senior diplomats were leaving Washington this weekend
to continue their negotiations on the Cuba document in Honduras.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is due to depart for El Salvador on Sunday.

US auto industry's future hangs in the balance
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, May 30, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The US auto industry faces a day of reckoning Monday, with the looming
bankruptcy of auto giant General Motors and an expected court ruling on the sale
of automaker Chrysler to a group led by Italy's Fiat.
</P>
<P>
The once mighty US auto industry is reeling from the downturned market and
global economic crisis, which has prompted massive intervention by President
Barack Obama's administration to prevent total collapse and a new body blow to a
US economy already in recession.
</P>
<P>
The government's rescue plan for GM could put as much as 72.5 percent of the
country's biggest automaker under state ownership.
</P>
<P>
With the hours counting down for GM, the company bondholders' Saturday deadline
expired without indication on whether they support the group's new offer.
</P>
<P>
If they accept the plan, the bondholders would obtain the rights to buy an extra
15 percent of GM's stock at a low price. They would also control 25 percent of
the "new GM," after having supported the new company's creation in bankruptcy
court.
</P>
<P>
Recalcitrant bondholders who opt for confrontation rather than cooperation "will
get nothing or very little," an Obama administration official told reporters
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Government-backed restructuring in bankruptcy court for GM, once the world's
largest automaker, appeared all but certain ahead of a Monday deadline imposed
by the Obama administration on the company to submit a viable restructuring plan
or file for bankruptcy. It could take place as early as Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a US bankruptcy court judge in New York was widely expected to
approve a deal between Chrysler and Fiat Monday.
</P>
<P>
The third biggest US automaker has declared bankruptcy and is seeking a tie-up
with Fiat in a plan presented as the only way to save the company from
liquidation.
</P>
<P>
Developments at Chrysler could provide an example for restructuring at GM, which
will similarly have to sell some of its brands and close many dealerships.
</P>
<P>
But the administration official said a 60- to 90-day timeframe was "better" for
GM, contrasted with the fast-track process for Chrysler, which filed for
bankruptcy protection on April 30.
</P>
<P>
"This is a much more complicated company than Chrysler, as a global company.
It's three times the size," noted the official.
</P>
<P>
The United Auto Workers (UAW) union said Friday its members ratified a deal to
allow GM to radically cut costs and its debt load, clearing the way for a quick
exit from the expected bankruptcy filing.
</P>
<P>
GM also announced plans to retool an idled US plant to build small cars it had
originally planned to import, and two more US assembly plants could potentially
be saved.
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy filing could also be sped up by a deal struck in the early hours
Saturday after marathon talks that saw Canadian parts maker Magna and its
Russian backers taking over GM's Opel.
</P>
<P>
The deal for GM's European operations, which was brokered by Berlin, amounted to
a major development in the global rearranging of the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
GM employs some 50,000 people throughout Europe and Magna plans to cut about a
fifth.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose government agreed to stump billions of
euros (dollars) in loan guarantees and emergency loans to keep the ailing Opel
afloat, acknowledged that talks over the future of GM Europe had sometimes been
difficult.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck had even denounced what he called
"scandalous" US negotiating tactics.
</P>
<P>
Yet despite what she called "huge mismanagement" by GM executives, however, a
telephone call to Obama helped seal the deal, Merkel said.
</P>
<P>
As for Chrysler, a new company could be born within days of approval for
bankruptcy. The Treasury said it had transferred 6.9 billion dollars in public
funds to New Carco, a newly created company to acquire Chrysler's "good assets."
</P>
<P>
If presiding judge Arthur Gonzalez rules against Chrysler, it faces a grim
future, with a worst-case scenario being Fiat abandoning the tie-up and the US
automaker going into liquidation, with massive job losses.
</P>
<P>
Legal appeals were expected if Gonzalez ruled in favor, meaning possible new
delays. Fiat has said it might back out if the transaction is not completed by
June 15.

Obama keeps promise with New York date
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New York, May 30, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US President Barack Obama swept First Lady Michelle Obama off to a Broadway show
on Saturday night -- to honor a promise made in the heat of his gruelling 2008
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Obamas flew to New York, not on the iconic presidential jet, but aboard a
small military plane -- still dubbed Air Force One with the president aboard --
for a meal in Manhattan's West Village and a night at the theater.
</P>
<P>
Republicans however immediately seized on the trip, accusing Obama of enjoying
himself at taxpayers expense, as ordinary Americans battle the economic crisis
and another iconic US firm, GM, struggles for survival.
</P>
<P>
Obama, in a statement issued through a spokesman, said: "I am taking my wife to
New York City because I promised her during the campaign that I would take her
to a Broadway show after it was all finished."
</P>
<P>
The epitome of glamour, the Obamas earlier left the White House aboard his
Marine One helicopter.
</P>
<P>
At Andrews Air Force base outside Washington, they boarded the plane, the
president in a smart dark suit with no tie, and the First Lady in a black
cocktail dress and heels.
</P>
<P>
After landing in New York, they helicoptered into Manhattan and motorcaded to
the Blue Hill restaurant, before heading to the Belasco Theater and the Broadway
revival of the August Wilson play "Joe Turner's Come And Gone."
</P>
<P>
Obama's Republican foes however tried to make political hay out of the
president's date night.
</P>
<P>
"As President Obama prepares to wing into Manhattan’s theater district on Air
Force One to take in a Broadway show, GM is preparing to file bankruptcy and
families across America continue to struggle to pay their bills," the Republican
National Committee said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The White House could not immediately put a price tag on the president's trip.
But US leaders, due to the tight blanket of security that follows them
everywhere they go, never travel on commercial aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, on the weekend before he heads off on a major trip to the Middle East
and Europe, Obama was seen cheering on the sidelines at his daughter Malia's
soccer game.

Susan Boyle's dream collapses as she loses British talent show
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scottish singing sensation Susan Boyle was dealt an unexpected blow Saturday
when she lost out to a group of young street dancers in the final of the British
talent show that made her a global star.
</P>
<P>
Despite winning praise from the audience and the judges in her final performance
on live television, the 48-year-old graciously accepted second place, saying the
"best people won" and wishing the winners "all the best".
</P>
<P>
Boyle enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame over the past two months after video
footage of her audition piece for the show, "I Dreamed A Dream" from the musical
"Les Miserables", was posted on video-sharing website YouTube.
</P>
<P>
It has had about 100 million hits, brought her celebrity fans including actress
Demi Moore and rock star Jon Bon Jovi and seen her feted in the media from the
United States to China, Japan and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Bookmakers made her the favourite to win, but after an unconvincing performance
in the semi-final there were fears that the church volunteer, who lives alone
with her cat outside Edinburgh, was suffering under the pressure.
</P>
<P>
However, in a live performance in the "Britain's Got Talent" final Saturday,
Boyle proved the critics wrong and repeated her audition piece with gusto.
</P>
<P>
Judge Piers Morgan said it was the "greatest performance I've seen on the
history of Britain's Got Talent -- you should win the competition, I loved it."
</P>
<P>
Boyle was up against nine other acts to win the show, which brings with it a
cheque for 100,000 pounds (115,000 euros, 160,000 dollars) and the chance to
perform for Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
More than a million viewers cast their vote following the live performances, and
in the end, Boyle lost out to a group of ten young dancers, named Diversity.
Saxophonist Julian Smith came in third place.
</P>
<P>
After singing earlier in the evening, Boyle, wearing a grey-blue, long sequined
dress, thanked all her fans.
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank people for all the support they've given me," she said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if it was worth all the media pressure, she replied emphatically: "Well
worth it!... I really feel at home on stage, I'm among friends."
</P>
<P>
Boyle put in a shaky performance of "Memory" in the show's semi-finals last
weekend, singing occasionally out of tune and out of time, and some fans on
YouTube had questioned whether she could handle the weight of expectations.
</P>
<P>
The British media had also reported some erratic behaviour over the past week,
including how she had lost her temper in the foyer of the London hotel where she
was staying prompting police to intervene.
</P>
<P>
Morgan said that she even considered quitting, describing her in his blog as a
"frightened rabbit in headlights".
</P>
<P>
But his fellow judge Amanda Holden said after Saturday's performance: "I have
never heard such powerful confident vocals."
</P>
<P>
Reports on Sunday suggested Boyle could make millions of pounds in the next year
if she capitalised on her global success, with the News of the World saying one
of the show's judges, music promoter Simon Cowell, had big plans.
</P>
<P>
"It's the biggest phenomenon I've ever seen out of any of my shows," Cowell told
the newspaper, which suggested an album, a film of her life and a memoir were in
the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Asked about her plans on television after the show, Boyle said: "I hope to get
an album out -- I'll just play it by ear."
</P>
<P>
She added: "What a journey -- unbelievable, and very humbling. Thank you for
everything."
</P>
<P>
Hoards of fans had gathered in her hometown of Blackburn near Edinburgh to watch
the final and support Boyle, and Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond also
congratulated the singer, saying she could "hold her head up high".

Cricket: Twenty20 comes home to England
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cricket's newest format returns to its birthplace when England hosts the World
Twenty20 from Friday with the event kicking off a bumper summer which includes
one of the sport's oldest combats, the Ashes.
</P>
<P>
But, as with all the other forms of one-day cricket first played in England at
county level, the 'mother country' has found herself having to play catch-up
with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Originally conceived as a fun way of bringing new audiences, particularly those
who couldn't watch cricket during the working day, into the game, Twenty20 has
taken the sport by storm.
</P>
<P>
Tournaments such as the Indian Premier League (IPL) are now far more lucrative
per match for a player than five-day Test cricket, the traditional pinnacle of
the sport.
</P>
<P>
India, whose administrators were originally hostile to Twenty20 because they
feared its commercial impact upon the 50-over game, won the inaugural global
tournament in South Africa two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Nine members of that winning squad, which defeated arch-rivals Pakistan by five
runs in a thrilling final in Johannesburg, will be coming to England.
</P>
<P>
But, in what above all other types of cricket is a game heavily weighted in
favour of batsmen, India will be without master run-maker Sachin Tendulkar, who
has now opted out of Twenty20 internationals.
</P>
<P>
Generally short boundaries and fielding restrictions put a premium on big-
hitting batsmen and in Yuvraj Singh they have someone who struck England's
Stuart Broad for six sixes in an over in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Tendulkar, who himself played in this year's IPL, warned it was important that
openers Yuvraj and Gautam Gambhir were refreshed after failing to find top form
in the IPL.
</P>
<P>
"I think the key would be how soon they can shed the fatigue factor," Tendulkar
said.
</P>
<P>
Wicket-taking bowlers are an invaluable commodity in a game where economy rates
can go out the window and India look to have a promising pace attack.
</P>
<P>
Left-armer Rudra Pratap Singh, who took 12 wickets in South Africa in 2007, will
be supported this time around by Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, starved of international cricket at home after a terror attack on the
Sri Lanka team bus in Lahore in March made the country a 'no-go zone', will
fancy their chances of going one better this time around.
</P>
<P>
"I thought Australia would thrash them in the one-off T20 match in Dubai but it
was the other way round and now, if Pakistan play to their potential, they can
win the title," Pakistan great Wasim Akram told AFP this month.
</P>
<P>
Australia have dominated all forms of cricket during the last decade except
Twenty20 and captain Ricky Ponting is determined to improve both his and the
team's record.
</P>
<P>
"The past couple of games I've played have been very poor," he said. "In the two
games in South Africa I made one in each. It's not great form going into a World
Cup."
</P>
<P>
Ponting gave Australia a scare when he sustained a hand injury during practice
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But he is still expected to take part - which is more than England captain
Andrew Strauss.
</P>
<P>
The opening batsman has opted out of the tournament because he thinks he isn't a
good enough Twenty20 player and the suspicion remains that England are more
interested in the Ashes series against Australia that follows this event.
</P>
<P>
England have never won a major international one-day tournament and they will be
without all-rounder Andrew Flintoff (knee), now replaced by uncapped leg-spinner
Adil Rashid, while doubts persist over star batsman Kevin Pietersen (Achilles).
</P>
<P>
But the IPL and subsequent international form of Ravi Bopara has shown England
that there is life beyond "Freddie" and "KP".
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka and New Zealand have repeatedly punched above their weight in
international tournaments and could do so again during a tournament that will
take place at three of English cricket's most historic venues - Lord's, the Oval
and Trent Bridge.
</P>
<P>
And the West Indies could yet put a largely disappointing tour of England behind
them in this format.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile South Africa, who won both of their two previous Twenty20s against
Australia, are desperate to add a one-day title to set alongside their
achievements in winning Test series in both England and Australia during the
past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh and Ireland, who have both enjoyed shock wins on the global stage in
the past, will dream of further upsets although, with both Scotland and the
Netherlands taking part, there is also the capacity for some hugely lopsided
results too.
</P>
<P>
For the first time the corresponding women's tournament will run in parallel
with the main men's event, with both finals taking place on the same day at
Lord's where, thanks in part to Twenty20, permanent floodlights are now a
feature of the ground.
</P>
<P>
The tournament gets underway on June 5.

Athletics: Gay signals his return with sizzling 200m
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK, May 30, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US sprinter Tyson Gay signalled his World Championship intentions with the
third-fastest 200m time ever on Saturday at the Reebok Grand Prix Athletics
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Gay, a treble world champion in 2007 whose 2008 Olympic season was wrecked by
injury, won the 200m in 19.58sec.
</P>
<P>
Only Jamaica's Usain Bolt, who won Olympic gold in Beijing in a world record
19.30sec, and Michael Johnson (19.32 at the 1996 Atlanta Games), have clocked
faster times in the half-lap sprint.
</P>
<P>
Gay, whose previous best for the 200m was 19.62 - in 2007 - said he thought 2008
sprint revelation Bolt would be "excited" by his time.
</P>
<P>
"I would think he would be pretty excited," Gay said. "This is good news for our
sport. It's good for both of us.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know when or if we'll actually meet for a race," Gay said of the
possibility of facing Bolt before the World Championships in Berlin in August.
"But whenever it happens it figures to pretty good and pretty fast."
</P>
<P>
Gay, who was competing in his first serious race of 2009 and had put in little
speed-specific work in his training, said he had room for improvement in his
technique as well.
</P>
<P>
"I got out fast, but was probably leaning too much around the turn," he said.
"That might have slowed me down some, but considering this was my first big
race, it was a pleasure.
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to stay focused the whole way, keep  my knees up, then when I
got to the straightaway, just run for my life ...  2008 that was all very
unfortunate," added Gay, who was injured at the US Olympic trials last year,
failed to reach the 100m final in Beijing and crashed out of the 4x100m Olympic
relay heats with his US teammates.
</P>
<P>
"But now 2009 is already looking pretty good, and the season is just getting
started."
</P>
<P>
American stars Wallace Spearmon (19.98), Xavier Carter (20.27) and Jeremy
Wariner (20.30) finished 2-3-4 in Gay's slipstream.
</P>
<P>
Bolt, who drew worldwide attention at this meeting last year with his 100m world
record-setting victory in 9.72sec - a record he lowered to 9.69 in Beijing -
didn't run here this year.
</P>
<P>
"I don't really know what his asking price is these days, but we probably
couldn't afford him," said meet promoter Mark Westmore.
</P>
<P>
But Gay's time was one of eight world-leading performances produced on Saturday
as he, fellow Americans Allyson Felix and Lauryn Williams and Kenyans Micah Kogo
and Linet Masai gave the Icahn Stadium sellout crowd of 11,127 plenty of value.
</P>
<P>
Proving once again that an Olympic gold medal is never a permanent invitation to
the top step of the podium, 2008 Beijing champions Tirunesh Dibaba, Angelo
Taylor and Veronica Campbell-Brown fell short.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's Dibaba had won Olympic gold at 5,000 and 10,000 meters and set a
world 5,000 record 14:11.15 in a brilliant 2008. But she was unable to match up
with Masai, the 19-year-old Kenya sensation, in the 5,000 here.
</P>
<P>
Masai broke away from Dibaba in the final two laps and won in a season's best
14:35.39, to Dibaba's 14:40.93.
</P>
<P>
Two-time (2000 and 2008) Olympic 400-meter hurdles champion  Taylor of the
United States hit the second barrier and was thrown offstride. But he rallied to
move into contention only to have more problems at the ninth hurdle and see the
top two places go to America's Bershawn Jackson (48.513) and Puerto Rico's
Javier Coulson (also 48.518.)
</P>
<P>
Jamaica's Campbell-Brown, the Olympic 200m champion, ran the 100 instead and
wound up third in 10.91 behind Americans Carmelita Jeter (10.85) and Muna Lee
(10.88) but their times were wind-aided.
</P>
<P>
Olympic 400m champion LaShawn Merritt fought through some tough in-his-face wind
on the backstretch and then fought off Trinidad's Rennie Quow (44.89) and the
Bahamas' Chris Brown (45.04) to take the men's one-lap race in 44.75, precisely
one second slower than his 2008 Beijing time.
</P>
<P>
"Given the conditions and everything else, I think 44.75 was pretty darn good,"
he said. "I'm ready to win the gold in Berlin."
</P>
<P>
Olympic silver medalist Jenn Stuczysnki won the women's pole vault in a season's
best 4.81m.
</P>
<P>
Christin Wurth-Thomas, a relatively unsung 28-year-old American, took out the
women's 1,500-meter pace from the starting gun and never weakened en route to a
surprising victory in 4:03.96, best time of her life and one more 2009 world
best.
</P>
<P>
  American women recorded three other world list-leading times: Williams in the
200m (22.34), Felix in the 400m (50.50) and Anna Willard in the 800m (1:59.29).
</P>
<P>
Micah Kogo delivered the men's 5,000m for Kenya in a season's best 13:02.90.

SKorea, ASEAN to hold summit overshadowed by NKorean threat
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SEOUL, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Korea will Monday host one of its biggest-ever diplomatic gatherings,
overshadowed by the growing security threat from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
Seoul planned the ASEAN-Korea Commemorative Summit to promote its "New Asia
Initiative" to strengthen its ties with the continent.
</P>
<P>
But North Korea's relations with its neighbour and the world have worsened
dramatically in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Last week it tested its second nuclear bomb, renounced the truce in force on the
Korean peninsula and threatened attacks on the South.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has heightened vigilance for the June 1-2 meetings with leaders of
the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations on the southern resort
island of Jeju.
</P>
<P>
"During the summit meetings, our military will escalate its alert and mobilise
additional intelligence assets," Lieutenant General Jang Kwang-Il of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff said last week.
</P>
<P>
One commander said any North Korean border provocation is likely to be timed for
the summit to cause maximum embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
Seoul says the North's security threat will be a topic at the summit, called to
mark the 20th anniversary of relations between South Korea and ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Leaders will also debate the global financial crisis, climate change and
regional cooperation in trade, economic matters, security and culture.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, especially as we entered the 21st century, Asia has emerged as
a great power economically and in many other aspects," South Korean President
Lee Myung-Bak said recently.
</P>
<P>
"That is why cooperation within the Asian region is important and that is why it
is especially important to improve ties between Korea and ASEAN."
</P>
<P>
South Korea sees ASEAN's almost 600 million people as a market for its export-
dominated economy that can offset the recession in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The resource-poor nation is also eyeing its abundant raw materials.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN is already South Korea's third largest trading partner, with two-way trade
worth around 90 billion dollars last year, and its second largest destination
for overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Korean investment in the region was worth 5.86 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The figures will rise further when the two sides on Tuesday sign an investment
pact, completing negotiations on a free trade agreement which began in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Lee is due to raise issues of democracy during a meeting with his counterpart
from military-ruled Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN has been reluctant to speak out against its most notorious member, but in
May it expressed "grave concern" at the trial of pro-democracy leader Aung San
Suu Kyi and reiterated its demand for her freedom.
</P>
<P>
"With the eyes of the international community on Myanmar at present, the honour
and the credibility of the Government of the Union of Myanmar are at stake," it
added.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi was charged with violating the terms of her house arrest after
an uninvited American swam to her lakeside home.
</P>
<P>
She has been under various forms of detention without trial for more than 13 of
the past 19 years.
</P>
<P>
"Our government is greatly concerned about the circumstances of Aung San Suu
Kyi," South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Myung-Hwan said this month, calling for
Myanmar's ruling military junta to travel the path of democracy.
</P>
<P>
Lee will use the summit to promote his low carbon, green growth policy.
Presidential officials said he would also urge Southeast Asian leaders to help
build a strong bond market in the region and fight protectionism during the
global downturn.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 business leaders from the 11 countries are due to meet separately on
Sunday and Monday. An Economic Cooperation Forum Monday will consider ways to
combat the world downturn which is threatening regional development.

Swine flu spreads across continent as Chile hits 250 cases
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Santiago, May 30, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chilean health authorities reported 26 new cases of swine flu on Saturday,
bringing the number of cases in the country to 250 as the virus continued its
spread across the continent.
</P>
<P>
Most of the cases are in Santiago, where two people remain in serious condition
in hospital, while health ministry officials also confirmed the first case in
the northern city of Arica, on the border with Peru.
</P>
<P>
The flu has killed nearly a hundred and infected over 15,500 worldwide,
according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, since it emerged in North
America in late April.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by individual governments, the virus has actually
now killed more than 110 people around the world.
</P>
<P>
In the southern hemisphere, health experts fear the new virus could take hold as
winter sets in and the regular flu season is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
Argentine authorities meanwhile Saturday registered 20 new cases of swine flu,
raising the country's total to 100.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 20 confirmed cases were found at several private schools in the
capital Buenos Aires, where students had recently returned from the United
States, said Health Minister Graciela Ocana.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak prompted officials to close the schools for two weeks in a bid to
contain the A(H1N1) virus.
</P>
<P>
In Colombia officials raised the country's total to 20 following confirmation
that a man and woman in the southwest city of Cali who presented flu symptoms
after arriving back from New York did in fact have the swine flu.
</P>
<P>
In Bogota a man who returned from the US state of Texas was also confirmed to
have the virus, but was recovering well, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan officials also confirmed the disease in four more cases, with the
Central American nation bringing its number of cases to 11.

Cricket: Sri Lanka's 'X factor' Malinga back in supernatural swing
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lasith Malinga is such an integral part of Sri Lanka's fast bowling arsenal that
it needed the nation's president to intervene and ensure he was fit for the
World Twenty20s in England.
</P>
<P>
The bowler with the rare sling-arm action, whose toe-crushing yorkers have
tested the world's finest batsmen, sat out the entire 2008 and early 2009 season
with a career-threatening knee injury.
</P>
<P>
Malinga, 25, was unable to run or train, and the swollen bone in his right knee
was so painful that he could barely climb stairs.
</P>
<P>
Worried the prodigious talent could be lost to the game, Sri Lankan president
Mahinda Rajapaksa recommended that Malinga should meet a spiritual healer
Eliyantha White.
</P>
<P>
"He (White) works with supernatural powers and herbs," explained Malinga. "I
don't know what he does or how he does it, but it works. I am very grateful to
him and the president."
</P>
<P>
The treatment lasted five days and the pain disappeared. Malinga was fit to
start his training. White later reportedly cured veteran Sanath Jayasuriya of a
long-standing back problem.
</P>
<P>
Malinga marked his return to active cricket with a strong showing in the Indian
Premier League in South Africa where he grabbed 18 wickets in 13 matches for the
Mumbai Indians.
</P>
<P>
"He is fast and furious and never easy to get away," said an appreciative Mumbai
coach Pravin Amre. "Sri Lanka will be very happy he is back."
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's new captain Kumar Sangakkara, who once hailed Malinga as the team's
'X' factor' for turning a game on its head, was delighted his premier fast
bowler was raring to go.
</P>
<P>
"He looks fit and hungry and bowled really well in the IPL," said Sangakkara.
"It's good to have him around again."
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's former coach Tom Moody, who now looks after both Western Australia
and IPL team Kings XI Punjab, said Malinga was an "unique" bowler.
</P>
<P>
"Everything about him is unique. His very unique action, unique that he bowls at
90 miles an hour," said Moody. "He is different."
</P>
<P>
Malinga's approach to bowling is simple and uncomplicated. Hurl the ball as fast
as possible, preferably near the batsmen's toes. It could rattle stumps or even
break bones, but will never be easy to hit.
</P>
<P>
Asked recently to name the toughest batsman he had bowled to, Malinga said:
"Lots of batsmen can be tough when they get in. But I try to focus on what I can
do. It just takes one ball to take a wicket."
</P>
<P>
He famously took four wickets off four deliveries in a World Cup match in the
Caribbean in 2007 where he guided Sri Lanka to the final with 18 wickets from
eight games at an average of 15.77.
</P>
<P>
A similar performance in the Twenty20 Worlds will see Sri Lanka progress far in
the tournament.

Cricket: 'Aussie' Nannes dreams of facing Ponting's men
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
THE HAGUE, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japanese-speaking fast bowler Dirk Nannes is desperate for the Netherlands to
reach the World Twenty Super Eights so that he can take on the mighty
Australians.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old left-armer had harboured outside hopes of making the Australian
team, but once that door was closed, he was more than happy to join the Dutch
squad.
</P>
<P>
Nannes has played for Middlesex in English county cricket as well as Victoria in
Australia and qualifies for the Netherlands courtesy of his Dutch-born parents
who settled down under.
</P>
<P>
His first priority is to try and help his team negotiate a way out of Group B
which features hosts England and 2007 runners-up Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
That would likely set-up a chance against Ricky Ponting's Australians in the
Super Eights.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really that fussed that (Australia) are not picking me," Nannes told
www.cricinfo.com
</P>
<P>
"Of course I would like to play for them, but I've been given a really good
opportunity by the Dutch team. If I play for Holland, I will probably make the
starting XI.
</P>
<P>
"If I was picked in the 30-man squad for Australia, the chances are I wouldn't
play and they'll play other people.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously I would like to play and I do think I would be one of the better
players in their team, but they chose not to pick me. I'm still going to go to
the World Cup and I'm still going to play."
</P>
<P>
Nannes enjoys the big stage. At the IPL in South Africa, he nudged aside Glenn
McGrath in the Delhi Dardevils line-up and claimed six wickets early on at a
cost of just 6.48 runs an over.
</P>
<P>
In Australian Twenty20, he helped the Bushrangers win the 2008 title with
figures of 4-23 to help beat Western Australia in the final.
</P>
<P>
A colourful cricketer off the field, Nannes plays the saxophone and even speaks
Japanese.

Cricket: Pakistan’s Gul ready to fire
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
KARACHI, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pace spearhead Umar Gul insists he will not curb his aggressive style of bowling
during the World Twenty20, saying his wicket-taking ability is key if Pakistan
are to clinch the title.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old, who is the leading wicket-taker in the newest form of the game
with 24 victims in 14 matches, is in the best form of his career.
</P>
<P>
The lanky Peshawar-born paceman boasts a career-best 4-8 - the second best
performance in T20 internationals behind New Zealand’s Mark Gillespie’s 4-7
against Kenya in 2007 - which helped Pakistan beat Australia in Dubai.
</P>
<P>
"I want to do better than the last time," said Gul, who finished as the leading
wicket-taker with 13 in seven matches to anchor Pakistan’s runners-up finish
to India in the inaugural World Twenty20 held in South Africa in 2007.
</P>
<P>
Gul said he sees the batsman-oriented Twenty20 cricket as a big challenge.
</P>
<P>
"Bowling in Twenty20 is a great challenge, but I am always up for it and I
believe in attacking the batsmen from the first delivery to the last," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gul will be spearheading an attack which includes fast maturing Sohail Tanvir,
Rao Iftikhar, Yasir Arafat and newcomer Mohammad Aamir.
</P>
<P>
The line-up looks inexperienced after Shoaib Akhtar was withdrawn due to injury
and with Mohammad Asif still absent because of a one-year ban on doping.
</P>
<P>
But Gul is confident Pakistan can still bowl their opponents out.
</P>
<P>
"We have a balanced attack and if we bowl to a tight line and length, then we
can get teams out or restrict them to gettable totals," said Gul, who prefers to
come as first-change in Twenty20 matches.
</P>
<P>
"Coming on first change helps you get more swing and it’s the ideal time to
not only stop the flow of runs but to take wickets.
</P>
<P>
"We came so close to winning the title in 2007 but it was bad luck," added Gul,
whose three wickets restricted India to 157-5 in the final in the inaugural
World Twenty20.
</P>
<P>
"This time round we want to finish it without a blemish. The title, nothing
less, is the aim."

Cricket: England get set for Twenty20 without Fred
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
England have never won a major international one-day tournament and, even
allowing for home advantage, it will be a major surprise if they come out on top
in the World Twenty20.
</P>
<P>
English one-day cricket has generally been based on the idea of the steady
accumulation of runs, followed by a dash at the finish, and steady, containing
bowling by medium-pacers who 'do a job' for their side.
</P>
<P>
What recent tournaments have shown is the need for wicket-taking bowlers in an
era where economy rates are of limited value, given how aggressive modern
batsmen are, and batsmen capable of scoring quickly, particularly in the early
overs of an innings.
</P>
<P>
The loss through a knee injury of all-rounder Andrew Flintoff, a dynamic seamer
with an ability to get reverse swing and, on his day, a hard-hitting batsman,
would appear to have robbed the hosts of a genuine match-winner.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, star batsman Kevin Pietersen's Achilles injury, which ruled the South
Africa-born shotmaker out of the recent homne one-day series with the West
Indies, also remains a concern.
</P>
<P>
However, albeit in a 50-over format and against opponents who didn't seem too
keen to be on tour, England won that series 2-0.
</P>
<P>
And emerging England quick Stuart Broad, himself a handy lower order batsman,
believes that Flintoff's absence need not spell the end of England's victory
hopes.
</P>
<P>
"We've certainly won well without Fred in the past, but it's important we play
good cricket," Broad said.
</P>
<P>
"He's obviously a very important player for us with bat and ball but players
step up and take responsibility when he's not here, that's very important.
</P>
<P>
"We need to gain confidence of winning without Fred so when he comes back into
the side there will be a lot of belief and confidence there.
</P>
<P>
"Fred is the sort of bowler who gets thrown the ball in an important situation
but when he's not in the side someone else gets given the ball and takes
responsibility."
</P>
<P>
But apart from three wins over New Zealand last year, England have not beaten a
major nation in Twenty20 cricket since levelling their two match series against
the West Indies at The Oval in June 2007.
</P>
<P>
England's only win at the inaugural World Twenty20 in South Africa a few months
later was against Zimbabwe, with the side losing to South Africa, New Zealand
and India.
</P>
<P>
However, England's squad does now contain players with plenty of domestic
Twenty20 experience in Hampshire all-rounder Dimitri Mascarenhas and Essex
wicket-keeper James Foster.
</P>
<P>
And England coach Andy Flower believes Ravi Bopara can provide the solution to
the side's longtstanding problems at the top of the order in one-day cricket
which have been an issue since the international retirement of Somerset left-
hander Marcus Trescothick.
</P>
<P>
"You must be able to adapt, have strong hitters and top-class batsmen up front,"
Flower said in an interview with the Big Hitter magazine.
</P>
<P>
"Ravi Bopara has shown what a class player can do at the top of the order, which
you need against the new ball - not just lower order sloggers thrown in."
</P>
<P>
England captain Andrew Strauss is sitting out this tournament on the grounds
that he does not believe himself to be a good enough Twenty20 player, with the
leadership passing to Paul Collingwood.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it (Strauss's authority) will be diluted at all," Flower said.
</P>
<P>
"I still think ideally you would want one captain for all forms but that wasn't
to be. We've just got to make the best of that situation."

Cricket: Scotland aim to regroup in World T20
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scotland come into the World Twenty20 desperate to be, at the very least,
competitive against the likes of Group C rivals South Africa and New Zealand
after some worrying recent results.
</P>
<P>
In April, the team returned from South Africa with its one-day status intact but
without a place at the 2011 World Cup that many had expected them to secure.
</P>
<P>
Roddy Smith, chief executive of Cricket Scotland, was frank in his asssement of
the team's performance, telling the Scotsman newspaper: "There are no excuses.
Quite simply, the team's performances have not been good enough."
</P>
<P>
Scotland, like many nations outside the Test elite, have a constant struggle to
retain players.
</P>
<P>
While the ICC makes laudable efforts to give them more games, team members must
decide whether they can afford to take time off from their day jobs, with only
three Scotland players on full-time contracts.
</P>
<P>
But there were encouraging signs during a May 28 Twenty20 warm-up match against
Bangladesh where Scotland, although losing by six wickets, did bat through their
20 overs.
</P>
<P>
Much will depend for Scotland on the form of captain Gavin Hamilton, who played
for England on their 1999 tour of South Africa, and Zimbabwe-born batsman Ryan
Watson.
</P>
<P>
He stood down as skipper after failing to guide the team to a top-four finish in
South Africa, which meant they missed out on the 2011 World Cup in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We are in a rebuilding phase and ... I know we have to give a number of players
international experience over the next couple of years," Hamilton told the
Cricinfo website.
</P>
<P>
"However, we have a fantastic and important summer of cricket ahead and it is
vital we put in some good performances in the next few weeks."

Cricket: Ireland set for tough Twenty20
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ireland will be looking to build on their reputation for causing cricket shocks
in the World Twenty20 but they face some potentially gruelling encounters
against the 'big boys'.
</P>
<P>
During the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean, they famously beat Pakistan but the
scale of the task facing them in this tournament was demonstrated when, during a
warm-up match against New Zealand in Derby this week, they lost by seven wickets
with three overs to spare.
</P>
<P>
Given that Bangladesh, one of Ireland's group opponents (the others are India),
took New Zealand to the last ball before losing in a warm-up match, the
prospects do not look good for the Irish.
</P>
<P>
However, Bangladesh are an unpredictable side when it comes to the big occasion.
At the same, albeit 50 overs per side, World Cup where Ireland beat Pakistan,
Bangladesh also famously defeated India.
</P>
<P>
Ireland coach Phil Simmons, the former West Indies batsman, has retained the
bulk of the squad that won the recent World Cup qualifiers tournament in South
Africa, with Jeremy Bray coming in for Andrew Poynter and Paul Strling taking
over from Eoin Morgan.
</P>
<P>
Middlesex batsman Morgan has 'defected' to England, highlighting a perennial
problem for Irish cricket in that their very best players, as was the case
before Morgan with fellow batsman Ed Joyce, are always likely to 'cross the
water' in search of greater professional opportunities and the chance to play
five-day Test cricket.
</P>
<P>
Ireland though will be bolstered by the return of experienced bowlers Trent
Johnston, Alex Cusack and Boyd Rankin.
</P>
<P>
And for all that India and Bangladesh will be expected to defeat Ireland, and
comfortably too, both will have in the back of their minds the fear of becoming
yet another famous scalp for the men in green.

Cricket: Gloveman McCullum holds key for New Zealand
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WELLINGTON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The weight of New Zealand's Twenty20 World Cup expectations rests heavily on the
shoulders of Brendon McCullum and his burning desire to be recognised as the
world's best wicketkeeper-batsman.
</P>
<P>
The diminutive gloveman is the key element in New Zealand's game plan with his
audacious batting at the top of the order and his lightning-fast reactions
behind the woodwork.
</P>
<P>
That the 27-year-old's name is often mentioned as a contender to inherit the
mantle of Australian great Adam Gilchrist speaks volumes for his ability.
</P>
<P>
In the Indian Premier League, the Kolkata Knight Riders valued McCullum at
700,000 US dollars, the biggest offer for a New Zealand player, when they
snapped him up last year.
</P>
<P>
They were immediately rewarded when he launched the inaugural IPL series by
smashing a record 158 off 73 balls and he ended the season with an average 62.66
with the bat at a strike rate of 204.35.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's 2008 Player of the Year has also won high praise from Australia
where a cameo McCullum performance helped New South Wales qualify for the
Champions League Twenty20 tournament in October.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt having Brendon McCullum in your team increases your chances
of a win, that is an undeniable fact," said Cricket NSW chief executive David
Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
In the just-completed second IPL series leading up to the World Twenty20,
McCullum's batting was below par by his usual standards, finishing with an
average of 23.75 at a strike rate of 119.24.
</P>
<P>
But ominiously, McCullum was working his way into form as the World Twenty20
approached with two knocks in the 80s in his last four IPL innings.
</P>
<P>
In a side which struggles for consistancy, much is made of whether McCullum's
best role with the bat is as a blockbusting opener or an aggressive middle-order
hitter who can get New Zealand across the finish line.
</P>
<P>
Coach Andy Moles is adamant he will lead with McCullum in partnership with the
emerging Jesse Ryder.
</P>
<P>
"Opening is Brendon's place," he said with memories still fresh of the way
McCullum engineered a clean sweep over India in their Twenty20 two-match series
in February.
</P>
<P>
McCullum carried his bat through both innings and in a dramatic finish to the
second game he calmly stroked a single off the final ball to secure the win.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand will rely on that same McCullum calmness to get them through the
World Twenty20, while the gloveman will be looking to enhance his own reputation
as well as aiding his country.

Cricket: Warner exclusively made for T20 pyrotechnics
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SYDNEY, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Australia's man in a hurry David Warner can be grateful for the explosion in
popularity of Twenty20 cricket.
</P>
<P>
It seems the diminutive opening left-hander and T20 are a natural fit, such has
been his extraordinary entry and impact on the stand-and-deliver form of the
abbreviated game.
</P>
<P>
Warner, 22, this year became the first player in 132 years to debut for
Australia without playing first-class cricket, such was his prodigious
reputation after clubbing a one-day record knock of 165 for his state New South
Wales.
</P>
<P>
Although not considered good enough to play Sheffield Shield cricket for NSW, he
ripped into the South African bowling on his international Twenty20  debut,
peeling off a rollicking 89 off 43 balls at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on
January 11.
</P>
<P>
Warner smashed seven fours and six sixes in his all-action innings to finish
just 11 runs short of becoming only the second player after Chris Gayle to score
a Twenty20 International century in his man-of-the-match performance.
</P>
<P>
Skipper Ricky Ponting compares Warner's rumbustious hitting with former master-
blaster Adam Gilchrist.
</P>
<P>
"He hit some huge sixes tonight when I was out there, it was some of the
sweetest hitting I've seen," Ponting said of Warner's cameo. "It was like having
'Gilly' there again."
</P>
<P>
His new-won fame earned an IPL contract with Delhi Daredevils and a deal to use
a unique two-sided bat. Warner hit 163 runs off 132 balls faced in seven knocks
for the Daredevils.
</P>
<P>
As the short-game batting sensation heads to the World Twenty20 he has racked up
177 runs in five innings for Australia at 35.40.
</P>
<P>
Warner has been described as pure cricket box-office and has developed an
aggressive switch hitting style where he often uses the back of his bat or takes
a right-handed stance to go after the bowling.
</P>
<P>
He generates enormous power from his strong forearms and uses his small stature
to get underneath deliveries and hit them high in the air.
</P>
<P>
In one T20 match for his state this year, he smoked a six off express bowler
Shaun Tait that landed on the roof of one of the Adelaide Oval stands.
</P>
<P>
"It's not like I'm trying to hit every ball into the next suburb," Warner says
of his pyrotechnic batting. "Basically, if it's in my area, I'm not going to
hold back.
</P>
<P>
"If it's ball one or the last ball of the day, I'm still not going to hold back.
I know when to be more careful, but basically, I want to score off every ball.
</P>
<P>
"I just have to back myself. You get a good start and the crowd starts going and
you want to keep going on the roll."

Cricket: Unorthodox Van der Merwe adds punch to Proteas
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JOHANNESBURG, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He’s an unlikely cricket star - a short, stocky all-rounder with a mediocre
first-class record - but Roelof van der Merwe has become a Twenty20 player to be
reckoned with since he made his debut for South Africa in March.
</P>
<P>
Van der Merwe’s nickname with his Titans franchise is 'Bulldog' and he lives
up to it with his aggressive attitude as a left-arm slow bowler, hard-hitting
right-handed batsman or in the field.
</P>
<P>
Selected for the South African under-19 team in 2004, his cricket career seemed
to hit a dead end and he admits he spent more time partying than working on his
game in his first year or so after leaving school in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
He started attracting serious attention in the 2007/08 season with his
economical bowling and effective pinch-hitting for the Titans in limited overs
cricket, helping the franchise win both the 45-overs and 20-overs competition.
</P>
<P>
On Twenty20 international debut he top-scored with 48 against Australia with a
frenzied mixture of wild hits and judicious bunts.
</P>
<P>
He swung his bat with such ferocity that one attempted pull shot flew off a top
edge over point for one of his four sixes.
</P>
<P>
Drafted into the South African one-day international side, he topped his
side’s bowling averages and was the most economical bowler, twice taking three
wickets in an innings in four appearances.
</P>
<P>
Snapped up by the Royal Challengers Bangalore, he became a regular member of the
team that reached the final of the Indian Premier League.
</P>
<P>
While his batting appears agricultural, his bowling is canny.
</P>
<P>
He bowls with tight control and his franchise coach Richard Pybus said: "He has
an instinct for anticipating what a batsman is going to do."
</P>
<P>
South African captain Graeme Smith likes Van der Merwe’s attitude.
</P>
<P>
"He really wants to be an active part of the game which, when you come in as a
youngster, is important. If you’re a bit sheepish then the game will test
you."
</P>
<P>
No-one can accuse Van der Merwe of being sheepish.
</P>
<P>
When he takes a wicket he roars his delight and shakes his fists above his head
like a victorious boxer.
</P>
<P>
And he’s unbowed when teased about his batting style.
</P>
<P>
"It’s not how you drive, it’s how you arrive," he said when presented with
the man of the match award in his first Twenty20 international.

Cricket: Gloveman McCullum holds key for New Zealand
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WELLINGTON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The weight of New Zealand's Twenty20 World Cup expectations rests heavily on the
shoulders of Brendon McCullum and his burning desire to be recognised as the
world's best wicketkeeper-batsman.
</P>
<P>
The diminutive gloveman is the key element in New Zealand's game plan with his
audacious batting at the top of the order and his lightning-fast reactions
behind the woodwork.
</P>
<P>
That the 27-year-old's name is often mentioned as a contender to inherit the
mantle of Australian great Adam Gilchrist speaks volumes for his ability.
</P>
<P>
In the Indian Premier League, the Kolkata Knight Riders valued McCullum at
700,000 US dollars, the biggest offer for a New Zealand player, when they
snapped him up last year.
</P>
<P>
They were immediately rewarded when he launched the inaugural IPL series by
smashing a record 158 off 73 balls and he ended the season with an average 62.66
with the bat at a strike rate of 204.35.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's 2008 Player of the Year has also won high praise from Australia
where a cameo McCullum performance helped New South Wales qualify for the
Champions League Twenty20 tournament in October.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt having Brendon McCullum in your team increases your chances
of a win, that is an undeniable fact," said Cricket NSW chief executive David
Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
In the just-completed second IPL series leading up to the World Twenty20,
McCullum's batting was below par by his usual standards, finishing with an
average of 23.75 at a strike rate of 119.24.
</P>
<P>
But ominiously, McCullum was working his way into form as the World Twenty20
approached with two knocks in the 80s in his last four IPL innings.
</P>
<P>
In a side which struggles for consistancy, much is made of whether McCullum's
best role with the bat is as a blockbusting opener or an aggressive middle-order
hitter who can get New Zealand across the finish line.
</P>
<P>
Coach Andy Moles is adamant he will lead with McCullum in partnership with the
emerging Jesse Ryder.
</P>
<P>
"Opening is Brendon's place," he said with memories still fresh of the way
McCullum engineered a clean sweep over India in their Twenty20 two-match series
in February.
</P>
<P>
McCullum carried his bat through both innings and in a dramatic finish to the
second game he calmly stroked a single off the final ball to secure the win.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand will rely on that same McCullum calmness to get them through the
World Twenty20, while the gloveman will be looking to enhance his own reputation
as well as aiding his country.
</P>
<P>
"I want to be the best batsman-keeper in the world," he told the New Zealand
Herald.

Cricket: Porterfield aiming for more Irish success
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ireland may be heading into the World Twenty20 without their best player but
captain William Porterfield believes the side can still achieve great things
during the tournament.
</P>
<P>
The Irish have seen star batsman Eoin Morgan called up by England just as was
the case ahead of the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean with Ed Joyce.
</P>
<P>
But five years ago Ireland still managed to beat Pakistan and Bangladesh - one
of their Group A opponents along with World Twenty20 champions India.
</P>
<P>
Porterfield, an opening batsman who plays English county cricket for
Gloucestershire, is hoping the form Ireland showed in dominating the 2011 World
Cup qualifying tournament in South Africa and then by thrashing Worcestershire
by 94 runs in an English Friends Provident Trophy 50-overs per side match, will
carry on into the World Twenty20.
</P>
<P>
He has already shown he knows how to play a captain's innings - his 69 off 110
balls was central to Ireland's win over Worcestershire - and Porterfield reckons
the side are getting better all the time
</P>
<P>
"The nucleus of the squad is still there from the 2007 World Cup. And we've
added the likes of Peter Connell and Regan West.
</P>
<P>
"We now have more depth and there's more quality to choose from."
</P>
<P>
Porterfield may be one day lost to Ireland, just as Morgan and Joyce have been.
</P>
<P>
But in the meantime his experience of top-class cricket - his 85 was vital in
the 2007 World Cup win over Bangladesh - could help the Irish again make a mark
in a global event.

Cricket: Hamilton looks to restore Scottish pride
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scotland captain Gavin Hamilton hopes the World Twenty20 will enable his side to
get back on track following their surprise failure to qualify for the 2011 World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
Long one of the most consistent nations outside the Test elite, a run of poor
results during the recent 2011 qualifying tournament in South Africa saw
Scotland fail to make it to the showpiece event in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Ryan Watson was stripped of the captaincy and in his place came all-rounder
Hamilton, whose one and only Test appearance a decade ago for England saw him
fail to take a wicket and record a pair against South Africa in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Now 34, Hamilton's career in England was to suffer dramatically when a move from
Yorkshire to Durham saw him get what golfers would term the 'yips' with his seam
bowling.
</P>
<P>
But he has been able to continue his Scotland career and now Hamilton hopes a
new-look side can give a good account of themselves in a Group D also featuring
South Africa and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
"We're realistic about our chances of winning games, but if there's ever a game
to win, it's Twenty20 because the whole thing can turn around in two or three
overs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a case of having people playing well and hopefully catching teams on a
semi-bad day."
</P>
<P>
Scotland face England in a warm-up match on Tuesday at Trent Bridge but Hamilton
said his 1999 experience would not be something he would dwell on.
</P>
<P>
"That was a long time ago," he said. "I had my ups and downs thinking about that
in the couple of years after it. But not now.
</P>
<P>
"It was an experience I'd like to change but I came away from that tour a better
cricketer."

Cricket: Broad looking for better headlines
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
England quick Stuart Broad goes into the World Twenty20 determined to make the
most of a tournament often seen as a hiding to nothing for bowlers.
</P>
<P>
Broad, at 22 an improving paceman and a more than handy lower order batsman, is
quickly becoming an important member of the England team.
</P>
<P>
But it says something about the self-belief of the son of former England opening
batsman Chris that his confidence was not dented permanently when, during the
corresponding tournament in South Africa two years ago, he became the first
bowler to be hit for six sixes in an over during a Twenty20 international by
India's Yuvraj Singh in Durban.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone can get hit," said Broad. "You can see that in the amount of Twenty20
cricket that is being played now.
</P>
<P>
"They bring the boundaries in, they make it smaller and everyone wants to see
fours and sixes. So, as a bowler, you've got to accept sometimes you're going to
be on the receiving end.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is how you bounce back, how you improve as a bowler and how
you learn new deliveries and practice different skills.
</P>
<P>
"It's important, certainly at a young age, to learn from it, take it in your
stride and turn everything into a positive.
</P>
<P>
"It was a chance to really improve me as a bowler and I couldn't be happier with
the way the last year has gone."
</P>
<P>
England were off the pace in South Africa, failing to beat a major nation during
a run of just one win in five matches.
</P>
<P>
But they will have home advantage on their side in a group that sees them take
on Pakistan, losing finalists in 2007, and outsiders the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"I think hosting the event is a massive plus for us," said Broad. "Twenty20 is
really big in England on the domestic side so to be having the World Twenty20 is
going to make the crowds even more excitable."
</P>
<P>
And while Andrew Flintoff's latest injury, a knee problem, has ruled the star
all-rounder out of the tournament, Broad said it was time England stopped
despairing when confronted with life without 'Fred'.
</P>
<P>
"When he's not in the side someone else gets given the ball and takes
responsibility," Broad explained.
</P>
<P>
"I thrive on that extra responsibility and I certainly like taking the new ball.
We talk about the first 10 overs setting the tone and that's my job with Jimmy
Anderson."

RugbyU: Johnson calls for greater England 'urgency'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
England manager Martin Johnson admitted his side needed to show greater
"urgency" against Argentina at Old Trafford this coming weekend after Saturday's
33-26 Twickenham defeat by the Barbarians.
</P>
<P>
An England team shorn of its British and Irish Lions and boasting some
unfamiliar combinations were 33-5 down against the star-studded invitational
team before a late rally made the scoreline respectable.
</P>
<P>
However, 2003 World Cup winning captain Johnson was worried by the way in which
the Barbarians were able to score five tries, including one from in-form Wallaby
flanker Rocky Elsom, the hero of Irish province Leinster's European Cup win, and
two from ex-England wing Iain Balshaw.
</P>
<P>
"We were hesitant at times and lacked intensity. We must play with higher
intensity and put teams under greater pressure," Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
"Defensively the way we gave away the tries was disappointing. It was poor and
our urgency wasn't good enough.
</P>
<P>
"We can't make the same sort of mistakes against Argentina. Some of the guys
hadn't played for a while and we'll have to be sharper," the former lock added.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be picking our strongest team against Argentina."
</P>
<P>
Ex-England captain Martin Corry, who played with Johnson at Leicester and fellow
World Cup winner Josh Lewsey, whom the legendary second row captained to glory
in 2003, both played for the Barbarians on Saturday as they made their final
Twickenham appearances before retirement.
</P>
<P>
Back-row forward Corry said it would be wrong to make too much of this result.
"The way England finished was key. Everyone looks at the Barbarians as a scratch
side but so were England," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Thankfully it was our talent that got us through but England have some very
smart players who picked holes in us. They were very impressive.
</P>
<P>
"This is tough for Johnno because he has got to start again, as this is not the
same side that finished the Six Nations."

Football: Cahill pride despite Everton's final misery
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
London, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Australia midfielder Tim Cahill insisted Everton had no reason to be ashamed
after losing the FA Cup final to Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
Cahill choked back tears on the Wembley pitch after Saturday's 2-1 defeat but
the Socceroos star had no intention of feeling sorry for himself for long.
</P>
<P>
Although Everton were briefly within touching distance of winning their first
trophy for 14 years after Louis Saha gave them the lead just 25 seconds into the
match, it was Chelsea who finished with the victory lap of honour.
</P>
<P>
The ecstacy of Saha's strike - the fastest goal in FA Cup final history - was
replaced by agony as Didier Drogba equalised before the break and then Frank
Lampard hit the second half winner.
</P>
<P>
Defeat was especially hard for Cahill to take as he had already lost one FA Cup
final with Millwall against Manchester United in 2004.
</P>
<P>
But the 29-year-old, the first Australian to play in two FA Cup finals, took
heart from the way his team-mates had dug deep to reach the final despite
injuries to key players like Mikel Arteta and Ayegbeni Yakubu.
</P>
<P>
"The best thing about this team is we stuck together, no matter what," Cahill
said.
</P>
<P>
"We've come so far with such a small squad and I'm just proud to be part of this
team and wear this shirt.
</P>
<P>
"I'm just gutted because this was a chance to win some silverware.
</P>
<P>
"But we lose as team and win as a team. We're going to hold our heads up high
and take this on the chin.
</P>
<P>
"We've had such a long season with such a small squad. I can't be happier
playing with a group of lads like this. I just hope everything stays the same
for next season."
</P>
<P>
As Cahill hid his face under his shirt at the full-time whistle, he was consoled
by Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink, who grew to admire the midfielder during his
spell as Australia coach.
</P>
<P>
Cahill was a key figure as Australia reached the last 16 of the 2006 World Cup
under Hiddink and he was keen to share a few words of encouragement with his
former player.
</P>
<P>
"I have a special relation with Tim Cahill," Hiddink said. "When I started
working with the Australians they didn't have the confidence to qualify for the
World Cup. He was one of the key players in that squad. You could use him
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
"I was happy he missed the chance he had (in the final) but it was typical Tim
to get in there. He is a big player and a big personality and a very beautiful
player in the Premier League."

Football: Cup Final hero Lampard salutes Hiddink
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
London, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Lampard described Guus Hiddink as managerial genius after the Dutchman
guided Chelsea to victory in the FA Cup final before saying an emotional
farewell to England.
</P>
<P>
Hiddink, who has been temporary manager at Chelsea for four months, is due to
fly to Moscow this week to resume his role as coach of the Russian national team
having made a big impact in west London.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea were in turmoil when he first arrived, having just sacked manager Luiz
Felipe Scolari following poor performances in the Premier League and a highly-
public falling out with star striker Didier Drogba.
</P>
<P>
But Drogba, left to train with the youth team by Scolari, completed a remarkable
turnaround in fortunes as he scored one of the goals in Saturday's 2-1 victory
over Everton in which Lampard hit the winner.
</P>
<P>
The result ended two years without a trophy for Chelsea, who are hotly tipped to
name AC Milan's Carlo Ancelotti as their next manager despite the popularity of
Hiddink who has always maintained his commitments with Russia made it impossible
to stay.
</P>
<P>
Lampard said: "Some people think that's bewildering but it's not. It was always
going to be until the end of the season so we understand. But he's been
absolutely fantastic to work with, every player will tell you that.
</P>
<P>
"The way he works on the training ground, how simple he keeps football is
something that is managerial genius. It's been a pleasure to work with him.
</P>
<P>
"It's sad to say goodbye but he got a couple of gifts from us all on Friday,
just as a gesture. We all feel the same and feel very close to him. I don't want
to sound too romantic about it all but that's true!"
</P>
<P>
Hiddink has left such a big mark on the Chelsea squad that many feel he will be
a tough act to follow, even for a manager of such immense experience as
Ancelotti.
</P>
<P>
Lampard added: "I think that's true but anyone who comes into a Chelsea job
knows it's a huge job. Success is what everyone craves here and quite rightly so
with the squad and the investment that here.
</P>
<P>
"So yes the new manager will have a hard act to follow but I'm sure he will have
credentials that will take the club forward."
</P>
<P>
Drogba has more reason than most to be nervous of what the future holds at
Stamford Bridge, especially as he is currently waiting to see what punishment he
will receive after being charged by UEFA for his behavior following the
Champions League semi-final against Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
But he was given a rousing reception by Chelsea fans at the final whistle at and
has yet to discuss his long-term future.
</P>
<P>
"The fans have been supportive to me," he insisted. "The only thing I have to
worry about is what happened after that match. But I'm delighted to finish the
season the way we have."
</P>
<P>
Drogba has been revitalised under Hiddink and was impressive again at Wembley as
Chelsea came back from conceding an opening goal to Everton's Louis Saha after
just 25 seconds, the fastest goal in FA Cup Final history.
</P>
<P>
It was Drogba who headed Chelsea level - his fifth goal in a major final for the
club - before Lampard's wonderful left-foot strike arrowed into the net for the
winner in the second half.
</P>
<P>
Drogba said: "It was a difficult start but you have to say it was a very good
goal. But our strength is to believe in ourselves and our qualities and we
played with more confidence. That's why we won."
</P>
<P>
Drogba also paid tribute to the effect Hiddink has had on Chelsea since he
replaced Scolari.
</P>
<P>
He added: "I think the discipline between us was always good. You don't win six
or seven trophies in five years if you don't have discipline in friendship. But
the manger has given us an extra bit."

Football: Hiddink dances into the sunset with a message for Chelsea
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
London, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guus Hiddink admitted Chelsea's riotous dance party after the FA Cup final was
the perfect way to end his brief reign, but the departing Blues manager wants
his side's victory over Everton to signal a more sedate period at Stamford
Bridge.
</P>
<P>
Hiddink joined Chelsea's stars in a wild dressing room celebration at Wembley on
Saturday, which saw even Roman Abramovich lose his inhibitions and throw a few
shapes alongside Michael Essien, John Obi Mikel and company.
</P>
<P>
A first trophy for two years does that kind of thing to a club who had grown
used to such occasions during Jose Mourinho's reign.
</P>
<P>
But, while Hiddink was delighted to savour every moment of a perfect farewell
before resuming his role as Russia coach on a full-time basis, the Dutchman
believes it is the Mourinho era that Abramovich must recreate if Chelsea are to
enjoy more champagne-soaked celebrations in the future.
</P>
<P>
Since Mourinho was eased out after a bitter power struggle in September 2007,
Chelsea have been through three managers and Abramovich is set to appoint a
fourth, most likely AC Milan's Carlo Ancelotti, in the next week.
</P>
<P>
Hiddink believes that constant change has had a negative effect on the players
and he wants Abramovich to stick with his new man for the good of the squad.
</P>
<P>
"We had a nice dance party with everyone participating, the players and the
staff," Hiddink said. "We have a multi-cultural squad and you must see the
African players; to see Essien break-dance is a joy.
</P>
<P>
"I did some good moves, the African way. At least that's what I was thinking!
</P>
<P>
"Roman danced with us. He is not a man of many words but he was in the middle of
the party.
</P>
<P>
"It was emotional in the dressing room because we were aiming for this cup.
</P>
<P>
"We had this beautiful African dance, then I gathered the players and technical
staff in another room because I won't get another opportunity now to speak to
them.
</P>
<P>
"I gave a five minute speech to thank them in a rather emotional way for the way
we have worked together in the last four months.
</P>
<P>
"Now I think stability is a big need for the club. They have had too many
changes in the past years and they recognise that themselves.
</P>
<P>
"They need a long-term strategy so that they can build a team and keep up their
high performance.
</P>
<P>
"The players know what they are capable of. This victory might be the foundation
for the future. They have shown they can do it."
</P>
<P>
After falling behind to Louis Saha's 25 second opener, the fastest goal in FA
Cup final history, Chelsea gradually overpowered Everton.
</P>
<P>
Didier Drogba equalised with a header from Florent Malouda's cross in the 21st
minute and Frank Lampard gave Chelsea their fifth FA Cup when he drove a long-
range shot past Tim Howard after 72 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Hiddink refused to rule out managing another Premier League club, or even
Chelsea, in the future, but for now he will visit his father before focusing on
leading Russia to the 2010 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
He will always have a place in the hearts of Chelsea's players and fans after
one of the most successful caretaker manager spells of all-time.
</P>
<P>
When Hiddink replaced Luiz Felipe Scolari in February he took over a squad in
danger of stagnating, but his direct, open approach produced a run of just one
defeat in his 22 matches.
</P>
<P>
And were it not for some dubious decisions by referee Tom Henning Ovrebo in the
Champions League semi-final second leg against Barcelona, Hiddink would have
taken Chelsea to two finals.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that controversial defeat was the only disappointment of his time in
England.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been even more perfect if we had been somewhere a few days ago
playing in another big final," Hiddink said.
</P>
<P>
"That is the only regret I have. I would have loved to play Man Utd in the
Champions League final, but it did not happen.
</P>
<P>
"I feel sadness to be leaving because the attitude from everyone was superb. On
the other hand leaving with silverware gives a feeling of satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
"This is the best way. You can say goodbye easier with a cup."

Football: We'll be back vows Moyes after Cup Final heartache
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
London, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Moyes insists Everton must use the pain of their FA Cup final defeat
against Chelsea as motivation for success next season.
</P>
<P>
Moyes' side were unable to take silverware back to Goodison Park for the first
time in 14 years despite the boost of Louis Saha's record-breaking first minute
strike at Wembley on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Saha gave Everton a shock lead just 25 seconds after kick-off, claiming the
record for the fastest ever FA Cup final goal in the process.
</P>
<P>
But even that didn't shake Chelsea out of their stride. Guus Hiddink's team
methodically worked their way back into the game and equalised through Didier
Drogba before Frank Lampard drove home the second half winner.
</P>
<P>
Moyes cut a dignified figure after the match as he insisted Chelsea were
deserved winners, but deep down the Blues boss was feeling the pain more than
anyone.
</P>
<P>
He knew how significant a Cup Final victory would have been in his attempt to
establish Everton as a major threat to the Premier League's big four.
</P>
<P>
But the numbing sense of a missed opportunity couldn't totally dampen Moyes'
desire to emphasise that Everton are still within touching distance of success.
</P>
<P>
"I said last year when we got the League Cup semi-final and lost to Chelsea that
the next step was to get to a final. Well, we've got to a final beating
Manchester United, Liverpool and Aston Villa on the way," Moyes said.
</P>
<P>
"The next bit will hopefully come next year and we'll win a cup.
</P>
<P>
"We know it's really hard to win things in England, with so many teams fighting
for just a few prizes.
</P>
<P>
"But for us to finish fifth and reach the FA Cup final, then come here and not
look out of place was a great achievement. We played Chelsea twice this season
and drew and this was only 2-1.
</P>
<P>
"I'm really keen that the players are recognised for how well they have done
this season because they have been outstanding."
</P>
<P>
While Moyes rightly takes great heart from his team's achievements, he knows it
will take a stronger squad to make the transistion from nearly-men to big-game
winners.
</P>
<P>
Injuries to Spanish midfielder Mikel Arteta, Nigeria forward Ayegbeni Yakubu and
defender Phil Jagielka deprieved Everton of three key figures for the second
half of the season and Moyes concedes that left his side short of the quality
needed to live with Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
"If Chelsea had gone into this game without Lampard and Drogba it would have
given us a better chance. And we went in with Jagielka, Yakubu and Arteta. They
are the equivalent players for us as those Chelsea players," Moyes said.
</P>
<P>
"Players like Drogba, Lampard and (John) Terry are the people who win you cups.
That is the level we are at.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to develop those players. We have one or two who are coming on. I
thought Steven Pienaar was outstanding. We just need a few more at that level
and then who knows."

Football: Rangers on holiday, happy with domestic double
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Glasgow, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rangers assistant manager Ally McCoist said he was looking forward to his summer
break after a Nacho Novo wonder strike won the Scottish Cup as the Gers secured
a domestic double.
</P>
<P>
The Ibrox side's narrow 1-0 victory over a battling Falkirk side means Rangers
can add the Scottish Cup to the Scottish Premier League championship they won on
the final day of the season.
</P>
<P>
It brings to a close a long season for the Ibrox side which begun with a
Champions League qualifier against FBK Kaunas on July 30 last year.
</P>
<P>
The Glasgow giants, who the season before had reached the UEFA Cup final,
suffered a painful elimination from Europe at the hands of the Lithuanian
minnows.
</P>
<P>
And while McCoist says the club will look to buy more players in the summer, the
fact they put the disappointment of the Kaunas defeat behind them to secure a
league and cup double was testament to the effort the players had put in since
he and Walter Smith returned to the club in January 2007.
</P>
<P>
"It can always get better in terms of the team and the squad. With a bit of luck
we can maybe add to that and look to strengthen," McCoist said.
</P>
<P>
"But in terms of what the boys achieved in the last two years the team deserve
all the credit going.
</P>
<P>
"Last year was so close to being the best season in the club's history. It ended
up being, in many people's eyes, a disappointment when we lost the league on the
final day.
</P>
<P>
"We can sit and talk about it all day if we deserved or we didn't deserve it.
The fact is we didn't win it.
</P>
<P>
"I just felt that this year it was a real reward for the players."
</P>
<P>
McCoist added: "I am absolutely looking forward to my break like you have no
idea. I've got the golf clubs looked out and hopefully I'll take a few quid off
the manager in the summer.
</P>
<P>
"I think the players will be looking forward to getting away from us more but
they really need a break, especially with last season when they didn't get as
much of a break as we would've liked."
</P>
<P>
McCoist also heaped praise on striker Novo, who scored 36 seconds after coming
off the bench at half-time.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard collected a Sasa Papac throw-in to send a sensational strike past
Falkirk keeper Dani Mello from 30 yards out as the Ibrox side lifted the
Scottish Cup for the 33rd time.
</P>
<P>
And McCoist, himself a legendary striker with the Gers, said it was a goal
worthy of winning any cup final.
</P>
<P>
"It was very good. Looking at the context of the game and the quality of the
goal it will take some beating," McCoist said. "It's certainly one of the great
goals to win any cup final in any country I would think.
</P>
<P>
"I can still see it. I was actually praying he would hit it as he got himself
that wee half yard in front and I thought, just have a hit and see what happens,
and I knew it would be close.
</P>
<P>
"Nacho is just an incredible wee guy. He's got a wonderful rapport with the fans
and the rest of the squad.
</P>
<P>
"He deserves his success because he works so hard every day in training.
</P>
<P>
"Anywhere lights up when the wee fellow walks in, whether it's onto a football
park or into a room, he‘s just that kind of person.
</P>
<P>
"If anyone deserves the success it's him as it's not easy when you're on the
bench."
</P>
<P>
And after securing his fourth double while in charge of the Glasgow giants
manager Walter Smith said he would be in charge next season to collect more
trophies, despite speculation to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly in Glasgow you are surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of rumours.
You obviously just have to wait and see what happens," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
"Going upstairs today (to collect the Scottish Cup) is the kind of thing I
wanted to do when I came back to Rangers.
</P>
<P>
"They are the kind of stairs I want to walk up. That's why I came back."

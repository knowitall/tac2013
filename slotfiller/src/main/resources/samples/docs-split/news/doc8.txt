About 2,000 passengers were given the all-clear to leave the Pacific Dawn cruise
ship here on Monday after Australian officials found none was carrying swine
flu.
</P>
<P>
The ship has been at the centre of an outcry after infected passengers were
allowed to disembark last week, prompting an explosion in Australia's swine flu
cases.

"No evidence of any additional cases of human swine influenza has been found on
board the Pacific Dawn, and most importantly, there has been no person-to-person
transmission on board the ship," New South Wales' top health official, Kerry
Chant, said in a statement.

<P>
Three crew members who caught the disease have now recovered and remain in
quarantine, P&amp;O Cruises said in a statement.

<P>
Infected passengers were among 2,000 who disembarked here last Monday following
an earlier cruise on the ship. Australia's swine flu cases, then fewer than 20,
had shot up to 303 by Sunday.

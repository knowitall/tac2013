The row over MPs' expenses is distracting Britain's politicians from confronting
the serious economic issues facing the country, a prominent business leader said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Richard Lambert, director-general of the CBI, told the Financial Times that all
the main parties should be focusing on their plans to deal with the recession
ahead of European and local elections later this week.
</P>
<P>
"I've just been talking to business people in Brussels and the sense of
bewilderment about what's happening and what it means for the UK and Europe is
palpable," Lambert told the FT.
</P>
<P>
"We've got important elections and they are being completely overshadowed by
these disclosures."
</P>
<P>
He added: "Clearly there's an enormous, understandable public outrage... but
we've got big decisions to be taken by all the big political parties about the
future shape and role of the state, and these have been completely brushed to
one side."
</P>
<P>
Polls over the weekend suggested British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Labour
party is in danger of coming third in the elections for the European Parliament
on Thursday, largely because of disillusionment over the expenses row.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Conservatives have also suffered from the scandal and
analysts expect fringe parties such as the anti-EU UK Independence Party (Ukip)
and the far-right British National Party to benefit.
</P>
<P>
Brown insisted Sunday that he was focused on the recession, brushing aside calls
for him to quit in favour of a more popular leader and saying: "I am dealing
with the economy every day."
</P>
<P>
In an article in the Daily Mirror, he also launched a strong attack on the BNP,
describing them as a "nasty extreme party" made up of "Nazi thugs" and urging
voters not to back them when they go to the polls this week.

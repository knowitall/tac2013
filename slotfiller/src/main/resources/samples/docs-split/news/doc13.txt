World football's governing body has been notified that its policies are "totally
in compliance" with those of the World Anti-Doping Agency, apart from the issue
of reintegrating players after a suspension, FIFA president Joseph Blatter said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Blatter, speaking at the conclusion of FIFA executive committee meetings here,
said WADA had confirmed that "FIFA's disciplinary code and FIFA's anti-doping
code, is totally in compliance with the WADA code".
</P>
<P>
The lone exception, he said had to do with when suspended players can resume
training with their clubs.
</P>
<P>
FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke said that FIFA's position is that a player
suspended for 12 months should be allowed to resume training after nine months.
</P>
<P>
FIFA and WADA had been at odds recently over WADA requirements on availablity of
players for out-of-competition drugs testing.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of January, the world anti-doping code requires elite
athletes to give notice of their location at a chosen one-hour period each day,
seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
FIFA had contended that players should be subject to testing when with their
teams, but not when on holiday.
</P>
<P>
World anti-doping chief John Fahey said FIFA's stance "ignores the reality of
doping in sport."
</P>
<P>
"There is no problem between the WADA organization and FIFA," Blatter said.
</P>
<P>
"The only problem that we had, which has now been put away ... is the question,
'Is WADA a service organization for the world of sport?' The answer is yes. WADA
is not a police organization."

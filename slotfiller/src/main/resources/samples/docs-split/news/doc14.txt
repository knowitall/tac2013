Authorities here on Sunday arrested a suspect in the death of a controversial
provider of late-term abortions, who was fatally shot as he walked into services
at his Kansas church, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Abortion doctor George Tiller was shot to death just after 10:00 am (1500 GMT)
in the lobby of Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kansas, police and city
officials said.
</P>
<P>
President Barack Obama expressed outrage at the fatal shooting of the
controversial doctor, in a statement released by the White House.
</P>
<P>
"I am shocked and outraged by the murder of Dr George Tiller as he attended
church services this morning," said Obama.
</P>
<P>
"However profound our differences as Americans over difficult issues such as
abortion, they cannot be resolved by heinous acts of violence."
</P>
<P>
Wichita officials said the suspect, who was not identified, was arrested some
three hours after the killing. Local media identified the suspect as a 51-year-
old man, who would be returned to Wichita to be charged.
</P>
<P>
"It's an unfortunate incident to happen on a Sunday morning," Wichita police
captain Brent Allred told reporters. "These things should not occur at a any
time."
</P>
<P>
Long a lightning rod in the bitter US culture war over abortion, Tiller, 67,
over the years had been picketed, bombed and shot in the arms, before being
killed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tiller's was one of only three clinics in the United States that perform late-
term abortions, which are performed on fetuses that would be viable outside the
mother's womb.
</P>
<P>
Late-term abortions are legal in Kansas if two independent physicians agree that
the mother could suffer irreparable harm by giving birth.
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred just two weeks after Obama sought "common ground" over the
divisive abortion debate in a controversial speech at one of the top Catholic
universities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
President Obama has attempted to defuse one of the most emotive issues in US
public life by arguing that while abortion should remain legal, the government
should do all it can to limit unwanted pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
But Obama has angered the anti-abortion movement by reversing predecessor George
W. Bush's restrictions on federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research and
for family-planning groups that carry out or facilitate abortions overseas.
</P>
<P>
Obama's choice for health secretary, former Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius,
has been widely condemned by the anti-abortion movement because of her ties to
Tiller.
</P>
<P>
His family released a statement saying Tiller "dedicated his life to providing
women with high-quality heath care despite frequent threats and violence,"
according to the local KWCH TV station.
</P>
<P>
"We ask that he be remembered as a good husband, father and grandfather and a
dedicated servant on behalf of the rights of women everywhere."
</P>
<P>
Tiller had been demonized by abortion opponents who regularly protested outside
his clinic.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, someone placed a bomb on the roof of the clinic, seriously damaging the
building. In 1993, Tiller was shot in both arms outside the clinic. Tiller
recovered, and his assailant received an 11-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 protesters were also arrested outside the clinic during summer-long
demonstrations in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He was acquitted in March on charges that he performed 19 illegal abortions in
2003 in a case which his lawyer described as a witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
Tiller testified during the trial that he spent years under the protection of
federal agents after the FBI discovered an anti-abortion assassination list in
1994 that listed Tiller as the top target.
</P>
<P>
Tiller was also acquitted of having an illegal financial relationship with the
doctor who provided the second opinion for the late-term abortions.

Britain's Prince Harry admitted Monday that he sometimes questions whether he
will succeed in his army training -- but said his brother Prince William helps
take the pressure off by cooking for him.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old, the youngest son of Prince Charles and the late princess Diana,
is currently training to be a pilot with the Army Air Corps.
</P>
<P>
Based at RAF Shawbury in the West Midlands, he lives with William, who is
training to become a search and rescue pilot with the Royal Air Force (RAF).
</P>
<P>
"We hardly ever see each other. And now we are living together and it's
fantastic," Harry said in a syndicated interview.
</P>
<P>
"(William) does most of the cooking. I spend time just lying around, watching TV
and doing my work," he said, and joked: "The RAF don't have to work as hard as
the army."
</P>
<P>
William is reportedly giving his brother advice ahead of his first helicopter
flight in the coming weeks, and Harry admitted that he had found the training
difficult.
</P>
<P>
"The flying courses are so intense," he said, adding: "It's surprised me."
</P>
<P>
He said: "There's times when I thought, you know, I'm really not cut out for
this, mentally. I hope I've got the physical skills to fly a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
"But mentally, there are the exams and everything. I mean, I can't do maths, I
gave that up when I left school, as anyone does at that age. But I've been
throwing myself back in the deep end."
</P>
<P>
Harry has recently returned from a two-day visit to New York, which he described
as a "nice break" from the training. It was his first trip abroad as official
representative of Buckingham Palace.

<P>
National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player LeBron James insisted
Sunday that Cleveland were on the right track, despite their painful failure to
reach the NBA finals.
</P>
<P>
James couldn't bring himself to address the media or congratulate the players of
the Orlando Magic on Saturday night, after the Magic defeated the Cavs in game
six of the Eastern Conference finals to reach the league's championship series.
</P>
<P>
But as he and teammates gathered for the last team meeting of the season here on
Sunday, James tried to put a positive spin on the Cavaliers season.
</P>
<P>
Cleveland notched the best record in the regular season with 66 victories, won
their division and swept to victory in four games in each of their first two
playoff series.
</P>
<P>
Then they ran into the surprising Magic, who had already ousted reigning
champions Boston in seven games, and even "King" James's heroics couldn't save
them.
</P>
<P>
"You want to continue to get better, that's all you can ask," said James, whose
team lost to Boston in the conference finals last year.
</P>
<P>
"We got better this season and I feel this team will be better next season. You
don't want to take a step backward. I thought we went forward from the Boston
series to this year and hopefully we can go forward one more time next year."
</P>
<P>
James certainly did all he could to take his team one step further.
</P>
<P>
His buzzer-beating 3-pointer saved Cleveland in game two against Orlando. He had
21 points, 17 in the second half, in game five, a contest that saw him finish
with 37 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists.
</P>
<P>
Now the big question exercising Cleveland - the club's management, his teammates
and Cavs fans - is how this defeat will influence his future with the team.
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers can offer him a contract extension in July. He can extend the
contract up to four years, or play out his current contract that ends after next
season and make a move via free agency. He could also exercise a player option
for the 2010-11 season.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't thought about it just yet," James said. "I'm just going to take time
off from basketball and not think about contracts or the game, period, and relax
with my family."
</P>
<P>
James defended his actions in Orlando on Saturday, when he strode off the court
- to a smattering of taunts from Magic fans - without congratulating his
opponents.
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't have much to say," said James, who said he had since e-mailed
Orlando star Dwight Howard. "One thing about me you've got to understand - it is
hard for me to congratulate somebody after just losing to him.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a winner. That's not being a poor sport or anything like that. If somebody
beats you up, you are not going to congratulate them (for) beating you up. That
doesn't make sense to me."

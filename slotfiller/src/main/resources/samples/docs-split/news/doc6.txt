FORT WORTH, Texas, May 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>

<P>
Steve Stricker birdied the second playoff hole to win the 6.2 million-dollar
Colonial on Sunday, leaving South African Tim Clark still in search of his first
USPGA tour title.
</P>
<P>
Stricker defeated Clark and Steve Marino in the playoff to claim his first title
of 2009 to go with his runner-up, third-place, fourth-place, sixth- and seventh-
place finishes this year.
</P>
<P>
For Clark it was yet another near miss. His 12.7 million dollars in US earnings
are the most of any player without a victory in PGA Tour history.
</P>
<P>
He squandered a two-shot lead with five holes left, including a bogey on the
72nd hole that forced the playoff.
</P>
<P>
He also missed a putt that would have given him the victory at the first playoff
hole.
</P>
<P>
On the second, Stricker stuck his approach within a few feet and Clark almost
followed suit.
</P>
<P>
But Clark's hit the stick and rolled more than 20 feet away. The South African
missed his birdie attempt and Stricker made his for a fifth career crown.
</P>
<P>
Clark, meanwhile, settled for a seventh second-place finish, including at this
tournament behind Phil Mickelson last year.
</P>
<P>
Clark, who started the day with a two-stroke lead, carded a 70 to finish
regulation on 263. Stricker and Marino both shot 68 to join him in the playoff.
</P>
<P>
Australian Jason Day carded a 69 to finish alone in fourth on 264, one shot in
front of England's Paul Casey.

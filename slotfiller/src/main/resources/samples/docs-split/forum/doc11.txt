Arizona House Votes To Repeal Gun-Free School Zones

The Republican-controlled Arizona House of Representatives has voted to repeal the state's gun-free school zone laws, setting up a potential battle that only Gov. Jan Brewer (R) may be able to stop.

The House on Tuesday night passed a bill to end the prohibition of guns within 1,000 feet of schools. The measure would allow anyone licensed to carry a concealed weapon to have a gun within the buffer. The bill passed with only Republican support, with all the House Democrats and several Republicans dissenting. It still needs passage in the Republican-controlled Senate and Brewer's signature to become law.

Proponents said that the law would make it easier for parents who carry guns keep them in their car to drive children to school or attend meetings. The gun couldn't be brought into the school building.

"It makes a difference if I park next to a property or 1,000 feet away," said state Rep. Jack Harper (R-Maricopa County) in an interview with HuffPost.

These days the Right fights harder to get guns into schools, than prayer into schools.

They only worship their phallic fetish.

9. The author didn't research the subject very thoroughly.

Most obviously, anyone who can legally own a handgun in Arizona and who is over 21 years old can carry it concealed in public without any kind of license.

I must ask those who are worried about this whether or not they believe that the existing prohibition could possibly have prevented anyone who really wanted to bring a gun onto a school campus for some nefarious reason from doing so.

I think all it did was inconvenience honest people who want to obey the law.

Clearly the countries at the top are doing it wrong, whatever they're doing. Gun crime is clearly too high in the top few and they should figure it out like us! If only all those people getting shot ALSO had guns they could shoot the other people BACK and pretty soon there'd be no one to shoot. More guns = more safe!

15. It gives police the authority to stop them 1000 yards away instead of after they are in the school

I suppose if you have a really good sniper rifle, 1000 yards is close enough. But you can't concealed carry a sniper rifle.

Of course, this assumes that the police actually ENFORCE the law.

<post author="krispos42" datetime="2012-03-10T15:35:00" id="p33">
74. 1,000 feet. 333 yards, which is well within the effective range of a basic deer rifle.

<img src="http://www.democraticunderground.com/emoticons/shrug.gif"/>

Not that any of this matters, really. If somebody is going to launch a sniper attack on a school, an unmarked, arbitrary line certainly isn't going to stop them. Of course, neither will laws against murder, or bringing a gun into a school building, or discharging a firearm within city limits.

Generally speaking people that can get a concealed carry permit are far more law-abiding than the politicians that make the laws. Now, Arizona is a bit different; you don't need a permit to carry concealed there any more, so that does not apply.

But the proposed law would retain the prohibition on carrying guns into the school building itself, from what the article says. If you carry concealed, you'd have to leave the gun in your car before entering the building. But if you're walking or driving or biking past a school and you get pulled over, you won't become a victim of the prison-industrial complex.

Hint: Every rifle from a.22 LR rim-fire on up has the ability to propel a projectile well over 1760 yards (5280 feet).

13. What's the big deal?

I sit here amazed at the ignorance I have seen in some of your responses. To begin, the government does NOT have the authority to regulate property that it does not own, which includes anywhere outside of school property in this case. What Arizona is considering is nothing new. Here in my state of Tennessee, parents with a handgun carry permit are allowed to keep their gun, yes loaded, in their car while they drop their kids off. No violence or mania as suggested, but such is always the case: there's always a bunch of talk when a "radical" gun bill is introduced that "kids will be in danger and how can those damn right wingers be so stupid", then the bill passes and nothing exciting happens. After that, nobody seems to talk about it anymore, then when another bill is introduced the chatter starts again. It has happened here MANY times. For example, in 2009 when handgun carry permit holders were allowed to carry guns into state parks and many local parks, there were loads of mayors, park rangers and police chiefs who predicted violence and all sorts of fanciful things that never happened. Tennessee parks are just as safe and family friendly as ever, and I wouldn't see why anyone would expect them to be any different, the states that legalized carry in parks before us didn't experience any such mayhem either. But I do know why this pattern occurs, people like to have opinions on subjects and most often they form them without any research into the matter at all. They just come up with things like, "guns and education just don't mix", but I really don't see how a gun in a glove box on the street 500 or 1000 feet away interupts anyone's education. If someone unauthorized carries a gun into a classroom or school building, it's still as illegal as ever, but anti-gunners will make it sound like the bill will make it legal for just anyone to bring their firearm onto school property, WHICH IS NOT TRUE. Only those with a permit can bring their gun within 1000 feeet or to the parking lot, which is a far cry from some pedophile being allowed to walk into a classroom with a gun. Just because you can voice your opinion doesn't mean you should. When ignorant people go vote on things they know nothing about, then we start to lose our rights and gain nothing as a result, so shame on to all of you that try to restrict my second amendment right while knowing nothing on the topic whatsoever.

57. So you support the notion that no one has ever been killed accidently by a gun?

Gun bans are not based on the concept that no gun can ever get past the perimeter of the ban, but on the premise that fewer guns equal fewer deaths by guns. People can and do get killed daily, by firearms, by accident. It is inargueable that there will be less death and injury by firearms in a given space if there are fewer firearms within that space. The concept that a space will be safer if more people were allowed to bring weapons into that space is fantasy.

I expect you will want to tell me about how safe you are personally with your own weapons, you are most likely right. Truth be told, that space is probably safer with an armed you in it. But you are not even close to representing the entire population. There are a lot of idiots out there and every single one of them work against your side of the discussion.

If you feel the need to attack me personally, you should know that I own and shoot several firearms, including a handgun. However, I have never felt the need to have one of them on my person or in my vehicle while going to a school. I acknowledge that I don't represent the entire population either, but I do believe for every instance where a crime could have been successfully prevented by a law abidding person carrying a weapon, there are multiple deaths and injuries caused accidently by firearms.

I would never ever in a million years think to attack you personally, why would you even contemplate such an awful thing? You began your treatise by proposing a utopia of sorts which contains no guns and 2 short paragraphs later express your own expertise and ownership of firearms. So the issue seems to come down to the fact that you (who has guns but poses no threat to regular folks) and me (who has guns but according to you poses no threat either) think nobody else ought to have the right. I think I get it.

72. No one can, or should try, to explain how a ban can exclude all weapons

Guns Bans are not created to do that, as no onr believes that a magic curtain can be raised which would turn back the weapons of people intent on doing harm. Asking for an explaination on how that would work is just a specious as assuming that no one has ever been killed accidently by a firearm. Notice that I asked you if you supported that notion, I didn't state that you did.

I proposed no utopia, merely explained that bans are enacted to reduce the number of weapons in an area, as that undeniably will reduce the number of deaths and injuries by firearms in those areas. More weapons = more deaths (remember those idiots) The thought that I envision any sort of uptopia, is merely an assumption that you know what I am thinking. There's some irony there somewhere...

I believe that people should have rights to own weapons. they are tools that have their uses in their proper arenas. I own a chainsaw, but have never felt the need to bring that to a school or into a church either. I use that out in the woods, the same place where I use my firearms. I do not understand the need that some have to be constantly armed. Maybe I'm just overly optimistic (my friends would be laughing their asses off at that) or just live in a very safe area, but I feel no need to be armed in public.

If people were consistent enough to never make a mistake, never have an off day, we could all walk around armed to the gills and make the people bent on evil tremble in their shoes. But none of us are perfect. There are times and places for firearms, schools don't enter that picture.

58. They dont but the other extreme end of the spectrum of advocating that people carry

weapons for "protection" doesnt work either imo as there was still murder, robbery and rape in the west back in the 19th century when people carrying guns was more common than today.

71. I never advocated for people to carry guns who didn't want to. Your straw man is dead.

Also your statistics are very wrong...the old movie genre of the "wild west" is still mostly fiction. In the 1800s a tiny percentage of Americans carried guns, even if you include the combatants in the Civil War in the 50s.

Maybe you could explain how have 120 armed students would have made the Northern Illinois U massacre (suicidal nut firing away in a lecture hall) better?

Yeah, it doesn't work and it only keeps people from practicing their constitutional rights.

47. Guns in schools were pretty common 50+ years ago.

A lot of kids in rural areas would go hunting before school, then stick their gun in the trunk and go to class. My dad said people would keep pistols in the coat room at his high school (he's 63). I have no problem with people who are licensed to carry concealed carrying on school property.

Besides, an ordinance that basically amounts to misdameanor trespassing isn't going to stop mass murder anyway.

59. No such an ordinance wont stop murder but carrying a weapon wont either.

If it did then there should have been almost no cases of murder or robbery in the west back in the 19th century.
The fact is with or without weapons people will commit crimes like murder and carrying a weapon either concealed or out in the open provides a false sense of security.

61. Murder and robbery were rare in the 19th century West.

Most of what people believe about the Wild West is nothing more than a myth perpetuated by Hollywood.

It's a sign of a character defect to want to carry a gun everywhere you go, fantasizing about one's chance to "waste a perp" or whatever phrase is popular with knuckledraggers these days.

76. I could never understand

How a "No Guns" sign at the front door will stop a potential killer.

Is there a special magic that is embedded in sign, or is it the pentagram under the sign? Does it turn the bad guy into ashes, or just renders all firearms inoperable?

Get real, people, it means zero in the eyes of somebody determined to hurt and kill. Even more, it means that nobody else will be able to return fire when it happens.
Sure, carrying will not prevent somebody to start shooting. It will be a much faster way to stop him than calling 911 and waiting for the cops to arrive thou.
It may work, it may not - but it gives you a chance. And that is all that matters.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but all the recent school shootings happened in gun-free zones. How did that work out for the dead kids? Anybody wants to go and tell their parents- yeah, sorry for your loss, but it is such a good thing that nobody could have shot the killer and stopped him, right? Don't you feel warm and fuzzy knowing this? Again, my condolences.

the AZ baggers to get some. Afterall the shooting of Gabriel Giffords has left the box. Columbine, Virginia Tech, etc get mentioned only on anniversaries and for academic purposes/studies. They apparently want their share.

CAIRO (AP) Â— The Arab League chief says the Syrian regime's killing of civilians amounts to crimes against humanity and is calling for an international inquiry.

Nabil Elaraby said Tuesday that it would not be ethical or moral to allow those behind the killings in the cities of Homs and Idlib to get away with their crime.

Syrian opposition activists have claimed that Syrian regime forces have killed scores of civilians, including women and children, in opposition strongholds over the past two days.

1. It's okay to COMMIT the crimes, but not to get away with them - two birds with one stone.

2. Pot calling kettle black. Saudi/GCC proxies also a murderous bunch.

There are no white hats in this religious holy war of armed Sunni insurgents versus Shi'ia soldiers. Lots of victims caught in the middle, lots of victimizers with blood on their hands on both sides.

5. What would have been a better position for them to take?

To make a statement in support of the killing?

6. Move their positions back behind the Saudi and Qatari borders.

The US and UK gov't also have no moral high ground after Iraq to condemn anyone for crimes against humanity. They can all get hanged.

3. A bunch of hereditary princes railing against the dictator. Okay.

How's that democracy movement in Saudi Arabia coming along?

4. Nabil Elaraby was one of the leaders of the democracy movement in Egypt

He is certainly no hereditary prince.

7. One group of Generals displacing another. I call that a coup. Unless you actually believe

that Egypt is now a democracy?

8. Then Why in Hell Doesn't the Arab

League do something about it? This is not our problem, this is theirs. Why don't they stop the bloodshed instead of crawling to us? We are not the world's policeman, boss, or Santa Claus.

Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks has been arrested as part of the police inquiry into allegations of phone hacking.

&lt;snip&gt;

Mrs Brooks was arrested under Operation Weeting last July on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications, before being released on police bail. She has also been arrested as part of the Operation Elveden investigation on suspicion of corruption.

Mrs Brooks is the only suspect among the six to have been arrested previously as part of the ongoing police operations. All the others are fresh arrests.

&lt;snip&gt;

It brings the total number of people arrested in Operation Weeting and its linked inquiries to 44.

4. Finally what ?

She's already been arrested before.

5. Meh, she hasnt been convicted yet nor has anyone else and the Murdoch family still runs News Corp.

If they can convict all those who are guilty including any higher ups like Rupert Murdoch if he knew and if the Murdoch family is removed from running News Corp then that will be the day to celebrate imo.

8. The actual chances of her being convicted of anything

were reduced as a result of matters discussed openly at the Leveson enquiry, which was public, which could now prohibit a fair trial.

The joke here is that the more this is discussed on blogs whatever the lesser the chance of finding a jury oblivious to all of the facts, rumours and innuendos. <img src="http://www.democraticunderground.com/emoticons/rofl.gif"/>

What on earth what is solely a current UK issue is doing outside of the UK Forum defeats me.

9. It is not 'solely a UK issue'

The Murdoch media, and all that affects it, is very key to American politics and society. Possibly even more than in the UK, because we have the balance provided by the BBC (at least until the current government finds a way to abolish it), while Fox News seems to dominate more in America.

And revealing sub judice information at a public inquiry is one thing; discussing the general topic is another - as if any of us here had information to reveal that wasn't publicly available.

13. Plus Cameron's long-term friend Charlie, and News Int's head of security

Rebekah may be the one in the BBC headline (she is the most famous arrestee, after all), but there were 5 others arrested too.

14. If it wasnt a paper owned by a major international media corporation it would solely be a UK issue.

However since it is or atleast was such a paper before it was closed its hardly accurate to say its solely a UK issue until the varies law enforcement agencies finish investigating the actions of the papers owned by the media corporation who owned the paper to see if it was more widespread.

15. Other than rumour

and clutching at straws there is nothing so far to date to demonstrate it was happening anywhere outside of the UK.

The sole claim by the Daily Mirror of events in the USA were neither backed up nor repeated by them.

16. No, the FBI is investigating whether it happened in the USA too

News International faces FBI phone hacking probe
...
One of the articles News International accepted had come from phone hacking was a 2003 story in the News of the World which referred to telephone calls Laws assistant Ben Jackson had made to him when he arrived at an airport.

It is believed the airport was John F. Kennedy airport in New York.
...
It is thought the possibility that Laws phone was using an American network at the time could lead to offences having been committed under US law.
...
An FBI spokesman said: We aware of the allegations of surrounding this matter and are looking into it.

17. I'd forgotten that

which was also last July - see elsewhere for "also".

I'd have thought that was a simple issue for the FBI to decide one way or another. Wonder whats taking them so long ? <img src="http://www.democraticunderground.com/emoticons/shrug.gif"/>

18. the FBI moves at an incredibly slow pace

we had a local issue that they investigated in 2008 - charges were not filed until 2011

11. You find that info elsewhere.

Her contract was settled, she was given an office and a job is on hold for her in Australia which she cannot occupy at present for reasons you will also find elsewhere.

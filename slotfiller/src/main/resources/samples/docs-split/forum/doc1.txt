Mitt Romney told Fox News that he would not pick Rick Santorum as his running mate because he's not conservative enough.

Said Romney: "Well, that would preclude, of course, Rick Santorum. Because, I mean, look at his record. I find it interesting that he continues to describe himself as the real conservative. This is the guy who voted against right-to-work. This is the guy who voted to fund Planned Parenthood. This is the person who voted to raise the debt ceiling five times?... Rick Santorum is not a person who is an economic conservative to my right."

In case you missed it, Mitt wants you to know he's a CONSERVATIVE...

No, really...

2. I nearly choked on my food.

"Mitt Romney told Fox News that he would not pick Rick Santorum as his running mate because he's not conservative enough. "

LOL

Is this tongue in cheek or to rile Santorum.

4. Depends on your definition of "conservative" I guess.

For example my definition of conservative right now can best be summed up as "bat shit crazy idiots who need to remove their heads from their inside their ass before they die due to lack of oxygen"

11. Related question. Who is the biggest dick?

Love the joke.

It's like this John Rogers quote:

There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old's life: The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs.

9. Romney is starting to sound like he is their nominee now, not just another candidate.

His poll numbers in the South have improved to the point they are near to Santorum's own poll numbers.
He just realized that he doesn't need Little Ricky to win over the South in the general election now.

15. Saying openly that he is against raising the debt ceiling--i.e., taking necessary

steps to pay the debts we have already incurred--shows that he is too irresponsible to be president.

27. If he doesn't understand that we have to stand by our debts, he is totaly not pres. material!

16. So I guess Palin is out...

We won't get to hear about how this current President has refudiated the squirmishes of the American people, and how we've got to stand with our North Korean allies. She'll have more time to read all of the newspapers in the world that way, though.

17. So Mitt is saying he is More Conservative than Santorum ? so when Obama says Mitt

is even more right wing than Santorum in October it will not be an issue, right ?

29. No, it won't be an issue

19. Like we believe that. Let's all just agree that the VP is either Christie, Rubio or Martinez.

The GOP is going to follow their same ole strategy. Last minute announcement in an attempt to ride a manufactured wave to the election. They are going to choose a VP that is a "future leader" in their party.

The not conservative enough comment is a poor attempt on Romney's part. What a troll!

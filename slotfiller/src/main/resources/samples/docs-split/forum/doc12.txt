A small-town Ohio police department was shut down Friday after a cop allegedly used a taser on a 9-year-old boy, and the police chief kept quiet about it.

Details about the taser incident on Tuesday are few, but the Coshocton Tribune reported that the officer had been called to a Mount Sterling apartment where a child was refusing to go to school.

At some point, the visit became hostile and the part-time officer allegedly used a taser to subdue the boy. The police chief is accused of hiding the incident from village leaders.

City officials suspended Mount Sterling Police Chief Mike McCoy for three days, leaving the village without a police department. Meanwhile, the office's computers and weapons were seized, and state investigators are probing the incident, 10-TV reported.

Early, Huff Post referred a suspect as a Thug. Here, they say the officer is "accused."

There is no bias in reporting these days.

BTW, officer should be under arrest for assault with intent to commit bodily harm. A nine year old boy refusing to go to school?

3. Time for that "Officer" to spend time in prison

A fully grown adult - cannot handle a 9 year old child without using a taser? That's beyond lazy, that strikes me as sadistic, as malicious... as just plain stupid and brutal. Could have killed the kid. Put the asshole in prison.

7. just remember, it's only an isolated incident

Cops are good and deserve utmost respect. There are only a few bad apples in the bunch.

12. You are right, but the problem is that when the "few bad apples" dont get

properly punished, it sets a bad precedence for the good apples.

25. I won't disagree with that, Suji

I will say though, that respect is earned. I treat Officers courteously as long as they do me the same favor. I've only ever had one argument with a cop - who thought he could swear at me and insult me because he wore a badge and gun and I did not. Fortunately his fellow Officer had a brain and managed to keep him from doing anything truly stupid. Unfortunately, that same offensive man was recently promoted despite numerous complaints of such behavior from him.

I am inclined to be courteous and kind towards everyone until given reason to be otherwise. Respect though, I give only to those who earn it.

27. there have been far too many of these "incidents" to continue to call them "isolated"

this is the best example of police using excessive force for compliance, but there are many others. i doubt the usual "police are always right" brigade will dare show up in this thread because of the victim's age.

4. 3 times according to link:

The child had 6 burn marks (2 per taser strike). This officer felt the need to taser a nine year old 3 times...don't really need to type or comment much more than that..

5. Our police departments have been militarized.

THIS....

is not conducive to empathy or good community relationships. Protecting and serving is giving way to control.

24. It wasn't meant to promote good community relations, this is just part of the furtherance

of the surreptitious War on Drugs strategy; which was intended to estrange and seperate the American People from their government.

As a result of the War on Drugs, the American People as a whole have been criminalized and it makes no difference whether you do drugs or not.

And how to we get them to do more suspending and probing at more police departments?

Why would they even send an officer out for such a reason?

14. did the officer TRY to find out why

the boy refused to go to school? Like maybe, he's tired of being bullied? Maybe he was threatened with being beat up at school?

did anyone TRY to find out anything, or was calling in the cops on your own child and then tasering him when he wouldn't comply the only recourse of action?

Yeah Huff post really sucks now

Their reporting of the Rush-Fluke story just did it it for me
and it was one of their reporters who had the most pro- rush bias

That second story in your post looks like a domestic dispute but abduction/thug is so more 'eye catching'

<post author="HisTomness" datetime="2012-03-12T10:11:00" id="p23">
16. oh, give me a break!

Seriously?
You're taking issue with the reporter referring to someone seen directly on video beating and assaulting a small woman as a "thug"? Maybe you should find something to hate on that doesn't make you look quite so foolish.

26. Again...what ever happened to the word "suspect?"

Even the LAPD that were video taped beating Rodney King were "alleged" to have done it.

Even R. Kelly was "alleged" to have done it.

There would be no problem if the reporter stated "police are looking for the suspect in this horrific assault..." Thug is an emotionally driven word.

17. The Fundamentalist and Militarist trends in our society are on display here. Criminalizing

childhood behavior and the over reaction by our militarized police are too apparent.
The only other thing we need is some one quoting "Spare the Rod".

18. You are totally correct.

This was printed in Alternet the other day.
<a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/154456/is_america_on_the_verge_of_theocracy_4_fun">http://www.alternet.org/story/154456/is_america_on_the_verge_of_theocracy_4_fun</a>

.here, an excerpt:

The governing-through-crime model that now imposes violence on school children all across the
country is a particularly egregious example.
How else to explain that in 2010 "the police gave close to 300,000 'Class C misdemeanor' tickets to children as
young as six in Texas for offences in and out of school, which result in fines, community service and even
prison time"?
Behavior as trivial as a dress violation or being late for class now translates into a criminal act and is
symptomatic of what attorney Kady Simpkins insists is a growing trend in which "we have taken childhood
behaviour and made it criminal."
All of these violations point to the ongoing and growing fundamentalisms and "rule of exceptions" in
the American polity that bear witness to the growing authoritarianism in American life.

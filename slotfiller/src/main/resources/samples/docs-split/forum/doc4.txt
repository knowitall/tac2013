(CNN) -- An apparent arson attack on a mosque in the Belgian capital killed the institution's imam and left another person injured, a police spokeswoman said Monday.

A suspect was in custody in the deadly fire, which occurred about 6:45 p.m. (1:45 p.m. ET) in the Anderlecht neighborhood of Brussels, police spokeswoman Marie Verbeke said. No further details about the suspect were immediately available.

The 46-year-old imam is believed to have died of smoke inhalation, while the surviving victim was treated for the same thing, Verbeke said.

2. right-wing wackos

This particular mosque has received threats from radical muslims in the past, and the man arrested is purported to be one of them.

Now, I think it's perfectly reasonable to refer to radical muslims as "right-wing wackos", but it implies something different to most people here.

4. I read the article and the comments.

Apparently this is a Shiite mosque and the attacker was a Sunni. Same old story that happens in many parts of the ME.

3. The world doesn't revolve around us.

This incident had nothing to do with Obama's reelection. The mosque was set on fire by a Sunni Muslim, a Salafist, to be more precise. In other words a Muslim attacked another Muslim.

May the imam rest in peace.

5. His comment is interesting though, and it shows that even on the left Americans see..

most things around the world as somehow relating to the US. IÂ´ve noticed this, and it has nothing to do with ignorance. I think it is because even your liberal media, like Democracy Now has a much more introspective view of things than European media for example.

For example, just about everyone in the US thinks the Occupy movement started in the US. But it actually started in Madrid, and has become an english-speaking world phenomenon as such. The Spanish are still at it though.

6. I agree.

I think that it's an American thing, regardless of politics. We seem to think that the world DOES revolve around us. It may surprise many that it doesn't. I also agree about the Occupy movement. I was in Europe in June. I have family in Spain, France and Belgium. Barcelona is one of my favorite cities and I observed that people were occupying parks there and throughout Spain demanding jobs.

We are a great country, but we are not the center of the universe.

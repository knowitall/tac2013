TEGUCIGALPA (AFP) - A 54-year-old Honduran journalist was killed by a machete-wielding attacker, police said Sunday, in the 18th fatal attack on a member of the news media in the past two years.

Police said Fausto Evelio Hernandez, was riding his bicycle on his way home Saturday when he was attacked in Saba, some 600 kilometers (400 miles) north of the capital.

Deputy police commissioner Osmin Bardales told AFP that the journalist, who was an on-air announced for Radio Alegre, "tried to put his arm out (to defend himself) against the first machete blow and had it nearly severed."

The attacker then let loose with nine fierce machete blows to the victim's head, the police official said.

1. Oh my god, this is scary.

I have people in Tegucigalpa, or I did several years ago. I lost track of them before the coup and I hope they made it back to the US before then! <img src="http://www.democraticunderground.com/emoticons/sad.gif"/>

Press groups on Monday called for an international investigation into attacks on journalists in Honduras after a radio host was killed by machete blows, bringing to 19 the number of media employees slain over the past two years.

Reporters Without Borders said Fausto Hernandez Arteaga, 54, of Radio Alegre de Colon was killed Sunday in Saba in the Colon province in northern Honduras. Hernandez Arteaga was director of the station's "Voice of the News" program.

The killing "shows once again the chaotic situation of lack of safety in which Honduras is submerged," the press group said in a statement. "An international investigation mission should take over the most serious cases."

Ortiz said 19 journalists have been killed over the last two years in Honduras and said "there are neither perpetrators (arrested) nor thorough investigations."

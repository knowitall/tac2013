Hello everyone!
- My name is Joe Herbert and I have been very active in gaming and
computer technology sense I was very young. I have graduated WarenTech
(jefferson county vocational school) with a certification in Computer
Programming and Technology and have worked as a professional QA Tech
(tester) on several Activision game projects (still under NDA).
Several years ago a friend and I had begun taking notes and writing up
plans for just such a project! We unfortunately allowed ourselves to
get destracted. We did not think we were ready for a project proposal.
I was amazed when I learned that we were not the only ones to think of
an open gaming platform. I would like to do what i can to help this
project get going and would love to share some of the ideas that i had
come upwith, aswell as some of the issues (that i have not seen
addressed on the wiki) that i had faced when trying to come up with my
own plans for an OGC.

- I look forward to working with you all!
Joe

PS: Please forgive my spelling :)

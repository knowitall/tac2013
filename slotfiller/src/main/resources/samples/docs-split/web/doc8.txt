Hi everyone!

First off, I want to apologize. I've had some trouble with my money
flow the last six weeks, and thus I haven't been able to get a stable
net connection yet. Also, stuff keeps popping up that require my
attention in the real world. So... :/ Hopefully, everything will have
settled for good in a month or so, and then I can finally begin to
work on the firmware for real.

So, since the pace is slowly picking up again, here's a general roll
call. Did everyone die, or are there people out there still? What's
happening? If you want to help or think you can help in any way shape
or form, please say so. And as for you guys, have you been doing some
research and stuff? Report in, soldiers! ;)

Also, it might be a good idea to meet in our MUC to decide how we're
going to move forward and see where we are right now, so, meeting
time! I'm suggesting a weekend in November sometime, anyone against
that idea?

I'm still interested in bringing this to reality, and I hope you guys
are. :) Seeya!

I'm still here too...but just like Wertigon, I keep finding life to get in
the way. This project is taking much longer than I had ever expected, but
that's okay. We'll get there eventually as long as we don't give up on this
common dream of ours ;)

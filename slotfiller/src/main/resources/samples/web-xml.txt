Why not use Pidgin with your gtalk account? Google opened up XMPP
usage not long after they released gtalk.

Tracking Affiliate Links With Google Website Optimizer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<POST>
<POSTER> travelhead &lt;joshwexelb...@gmail.com&gt; </POSTER>
<POSTDATE> 2007-12-20T18:16:44 </POSTDATE>
Hello!

I've used GWO in the past with my clients, but I've never tried using
it to track affiliate links.  Meaning, I have a link on my page that
goes to a website on another domain. If someone clicks the link, it
should be registered as a conversion event.

I've research this a bit, and found a few posts describing some sort
of a solution.

I came upon this code:

&lt;script&gt;
if(typeof(urchinTracker)!='function')document.write('&lt;sc'+'ript
src=&quot;'+
'http'+(document.location.protocol=='https:'?'s://ssl':'://www')+
'.google-analytics.com/urchin.js'+' &quot;&gt;&lt;/sc'+'ript&gt;')
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Click on this link&lt;a
href=http://
www.blah.com/payme onclick=&quot;_uacct=' UA-XXXXXXX-X'; urchinTracker('/
XXXXXXXXX/goal'); return true;&quot;&gt;
here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

I can see how it's using an onClick event, but I wasn't sure how that
ties into GWO.

For example, here's the link I want to track &lt;a href=&quot;http://
www.keywordresearching.com/recommends/keycompete &quot;
onClick=&quot;javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/
keycompete/');&quot;&gt;KeyCompete&lt;/a&gt;

I'm already using that link to track onClick events as a Goal for
Google Analytics.

Now I want to tie in GWO.

Any ideas?

Thanks!
Joshua

Hi everyone!

First off, I want to apologize. I've had some trouble with my money
flow the last six weeks, and thus I haven't been able to get a stable
net connection yet. Also, stuff keeps popping up that require my
attention in the real world. So... :/ Hopefully, everything will have
settled for good in a month or so, and then I can finally begin to
work on the firmware for real.

So, since the pace is slowly picking up again, here's a general roll
call. Did everyone die, or are there people out there still? What's
happening? If you want to help or think you can help in any way shape
or form, please say so. And as for you guys, have you been doing some
research and stuff? Report in, soldiers! ;)

Also, it might be a good idea to meet in our MUC to decide how we're
going to move forward and see where we are right now, so, meeting
time! I'm suggesting a weekend in November sometime, anyone against
that idea?

I'm still interested in bringing this to reality, and I hope you guys
are. :) Seeya!

I'm still here too...but just like Wertigon, I keep finding life to get in
the way. This project is taking much longer than I had ever expected, but
that's okay. We'll get there eventually as long as we don't give up on this
common dream of ours ;)

Hi, i'm new to the consortium and would like to ask a few questions.
Firstly this is the first online project i've joined so this is all
new to me. I've been reading some of the posts, and in addition derick
mentioned in his email that your at the stage of trying to get a os/
distro off the ground. Hows it going? What/have you many any decisions
about it yet?

Hi merlinwood, and welcome to the OGC project!

Right now things are going slow, mostly due to real life issues for me
and the fact that we're such a small community. I'm hoping that I can
pick up the pace in October sometime. Right now we haven't made too
many decisions, nothing is set in stone, but the general idea is to
develop a firmware that is capable of running OpenGL/AL and OIS
(Object-oriented Input System). On top of that we'll put something we
call the &quot;HomeUI&quot;, which is essentially a few modules with the same
generic GUI, and we'll develop it in Python.

Hopefully, this will take around six months to complete once I can get
started. We're happy with any help we can get. :)

Hello everyone!
- My name is Joe Herbert and I have been very active in gaming and
computer technology sense I was very young. I have graduated WarenTech
(jefferson county vocational school) with a certification in Computer
Programming and Technology and have worked as a professional QA Tech
(tester) on several Activision game projects (still under NDA).
Several years ago a friend and I had begun taking notes and writing up
plans for just such a project! We unfortunately allowed ourselves to
get destracted. We did not think we were ready for a project proposal.
I was amazed when I learned that we were not the only ones to think of
an open gaming platform. I would like to do what i can to help this
project get going and would love to share some of the ideas that i had
come upwith, aswell as some of the issues (that i have not seen
addressed on the wiki) that i had faced when trying to come up with my
own plans for an OGC.

- I look forward to working with you all!
Joe

PS: Please forgive my spelling :)

Hi,

Our Google group has around 20 members. It is a good start. To begin,

To facilitate the communication, please set the &quot;Name&quot; field of your
group membership information following what I and Zhao Ye have done.
The format  is &quot;Name (Institute)&quot;.

Cheers,

Hello,ShangShu,

if you are looking for Post-doc vacancy, here in my university now opens
some post-doc fellowship. the payment is quite ok. it is about RM4000~RM7000
depending on your previous experiences and research publications. (1 US$ =
3.5 Ringgit Malaysia). and the living cost is not higher than Shanghai or
other major cities in China.

you might refer url below

and my supervisor is looking for some post-doc.his webpage is
http://www.cs.usm.my/seorang.php?s_id=215

thank you

regards

Yours

I extended the current (read: nearly non-existent) documentation on
the jOWL library.

The documentation has been stored as an OWL-DL file, and is browsed
with jOWL itself. Providing some nice functionality in my opinion.

Released jOWL 0.5 ( http://code.google.com/p/jowl-plugin/ ),
this version includes the indexing of rdf:about attributes that makes
browsing of BFO and other ontologies possible (as for example at
http://jowl.ontologyonline.org/bfo.html ). I also expanded the demo
section, you can read about it in the blog post:

David,

I just read your post on embedding rdf in xhtml.  I like where you're
going, but I'm skeptical about embedding rdf with xhtml.  Microformats
seem to scratch an itch for designers, and designers tend to have the
power to get them released on their site.

When the source is a backend that's already capable of creating rdf
formatted data, I'd imagine a discoverable link within the xhtml would
be better...something similar to auto discovered RSS, operator would
recognize a div/span and be redirected to the end point that provides
RDF.

The problem with OWL/RDF is that it isn't well specified for common
domains.  Take for example the ical ontology posted on the w3c.  Load
that up into Protege and it doesn't even recognize the date fields as
dates, they aren't specified as 'functional' and allow multiple
entries...you cannot have an event start at two times.  It's just a
really poor example of owl, and yet, that's supposed to be the OWL
version of vCalendar.  The microformat standard is better.  Go ahead,
load this up in Protege http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal/ical .  Even if
we want to share our data, it's not clear what ontology we should use!

At the spring semweb conference in San Jose somebody gave a talk on
embedding rdf in Atom...at first I thought that it was an odd idea,
but he's right, it's a really good idea.  Google is using Atom for
it's open social.  So the XHTML would frame a region and point the
plugin to the rdf endpoint, and it'd probably be best to deliver it
via Atom...which I think would allow the rdf to be more normal,
regular rdf, as opposed to RDFa.

My (small) dissappointment in Microformats is really that they force
you to use a kind of pre-defined structure (basically templates) to
make the data machine-readable. That's fine when we are talking about
vCards, or address specifications, but what if I wish to to do same
for food, or movies, books or other topics. You'd need a microformat
specification for each one of them. A common syntax to express
ontological data would allow us to overcome these limitations, as you
can somehow separate meaning versus representation. I do agree OWL has
it's limitations (for one that has been addressed by OWL 1.1; cfr an
earlier post of mine: http://lists.tdwg.org/pipermail/tdwg-tag/2006-September/000171.html ),
but currently I know of no other ontology language that has (being
xml / RDF based) to possibility to integrate with web content. One
thing I am thinking of is that you could markup sections of text with
reference to an ontology class they are referring to, and more or less
forget about advanced relating. Very Rudimentary example:
&lt;div instanceof=&quot;someontology#address&quot;&gt;
&lt;span instanceof=&quot;someontology#street&quot;&gt;some street&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
instanceof=&quot;someontology#country&quot;&gt;France&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
By reasoning over the tagged classes the relations could be extracted
by itself and a template might be generated. I must agree this thought
is quite primitive at the moment, and yes, there still should be a
reference ontology to which you refer (although if you abstract it you
might try and let go explicit ontology references in the above
examples (instanceof=&quot;street&quot;, instanceof=&quot;country&quot; etc) and let an
application that works with the data disambiguate the meaning of it.
All very hypothetical of course.

In the case of the ical example, I believe it would be better if the
rdf:datatype would be made explicit as xsd:date-time (instead of
integer as it is now), and if I am correct the property should be
declared as datatypeproperty as well. So there might be some design
imperfections, and perhaps correcting these might lead to a better
recognition in Protege. It just shows that OWL is not very accessible
to many (and also got me puzzled now and then) and is really still in
it's infancy.

Perhaps putting RDF into Atom feeds would allow you to achieve certain
things, but in my opinion the direct tagging of content with semantic
classes, although very impractical, might definately have some
advantages as well.

I wrote the article (in the same way that I use the website) to try
and explore some ideas I have, whether embedding OWL in XHTML will or
will not be a mainstream, the fact that it is possible already got me
(and I hope others) thinking, and we all know the semantic web
requires a serious push in the back.

David.

i have been thinking for some time about a use case where i use rdfa
to mark up extensive web-based lectures for students. this would
require creating an ontology for the course topic which may at first
be problematic but may well be adopted by publishers if successful.
this would allow reasoning and relationships between the lecture, the
course discussions, assessments such as carefully structured multiple
guess, and other course elements. your article is very interesting to
me with reference to this project. these kinds of applications of rdfa
are not directly related to data exchange (at least at first), but
allow the semantic web to be used to create content and then actually
use that content outside the web page.

That is exactly the kind of use-case I'm having in mind as well.
And true, it would require an ontology about your domain of discourse
first.
On top of that particular usecase of RDfa, having the ontology content
easily accessible (and hence, easily referencable) would promote the
use of it, which in my opinion provides arguments for publishing the
ontology within regular web pages as well.
Publishing the ontology within web pages would could also make it more
transparant to the user and thereby let him understand the content
better, that is something you will never achieve by just looking at
the OWL syntax (or any other syntax you express your ontology in),
which by definition facilitates machine-readability, not human
understanding....(For a concrete example: any concept page of
http://ontologyonline.org versus the owl syntax that can also be shown
when selecting the 'Show OWL syntax' option present on those pages).

I uploaded a new jOWL demo which demonstrates the new rdf:about
indexing functionality (better compatibility with the different ways
to express ontology entries with OWL-DL ).

The demo allows for online browsing of BFO, the Basic formal ontology.
BFO 1.1 can be browsed in it's unmodified form with jOWL online at:
http://jowl.ontologyonline.org/bfo.html

MAKE QUICK LEGAL EASY MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;
Turn $5.00 into $42,000, WITH HARDLY ANY WORK.... read this to find
out how!!!!
READING THIS COULD CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!! I found this on a bulletin
board and decided to try it. A little while back, I was browsing
through
newsgroups, just like you are now, and came across an article similar
to this
that said you could make thousands of cash within weeks with only an
initial
investment of $5.00!! So I thought, &quot;Yeah right, this must  be a
scam&quot;, but like
most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading.
Before you get skeptical, just take a few minutes to fishish
reading this.
WITH THIS PLAN, YOU REALLY CAN MAKE TONS OF TOTALLY LEGAL, FAST
AND EASY CASH MONEY!! IT WORKS!!! BUT YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW IT CAREFULLY
FOR IT TO WORK CORRECTLY AND IN YOUR FAVOR!!!! WITH ALL THE MONEY
YOU ARE GONNA MAKE, YOU WILL SOON GET EVERTHING YOU'VE  ALWAYS DREAMED
OF!!!!
Here's how it works. All you do is send $1.00 to each of the 5
names and address stated in
the article. You then place your own name and address in the bottom of
the list at #5, and
post the article in at least 200 newsgroups. (There are thousands.) No
catch, that was it. So after
thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about
trying it. I figured, what have
I got to lose except 5 stamps and $5.00, right? Like most of us I was
a little skeptical and a little
worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with
the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161)
and they confirmed that it is indeed legal! Then I invested the
measly $5.00.
Well, GUESS WHAT!!... Within 7 days, I started getting money in
the mail! I was shocked!
I figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in. In my
first week, I made about
$25.00. By the end of the second week I had made a total of over
$1,000! In the third week I had
over $10,000 and it's still growing. This is now my fourth week and I
have made a total of
just over $42,000.00, and it's still coming in rapidly. It's certainly
worth $5.00, and 5 stamps.
By the way, I have spent more than that on the lottery in the last
month!! Let me tell you how this
works and most importantly, why it works....also, make sure you print
a copy of this
article NOW, so you can get the information off of it as you  need
it.

STEP 1: Get 5 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each
piece of paper,
&quot;PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST.&quot;
Also, be sure to include your name and address. Now, get 5 U.S.
$1.00 bills and
place ONE inside EACH of the 5 pieces of paper so the bill will not be
seen through
the envelope, to prevent thievery. Next, place one paper in each of
the 5
envelopes and seal them. You should now have 5 sealed envelopes, each
with a piece
of paper stating the above phrase, your name and address, and a $1.00
bill. What you
are doing is creating a service by this. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!
Mail the 5 envelopes to the following addresses:

:#1) CINDY  MCCLANAHAN
7656  SOMERSET LN.
MANASSAS, VA. 20111

: #2) AILENE  BESS
P.O.BOX 24403
DETROIT, MI 48224

: #3) ILENE  ELLIS
10314 BERKSHIRE  ST.

18432  VANOWEN  ST.
RESEDA, CA  91335

#5) ANGELA  ROCKWELL
P.O.BOX 146
FRANKFORT, ME  04438

STEP 2:   Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above,
move the other
names up (5 becomes 4, 4 becomes 3, etc...) and add YOUR Name as
number 5
on the list.
STEP 3:   Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article
as close to
original as possible. If you do not live in the U.S. or there is a
foreign address, you
must put an international stamp on your envelopes. Now, post your
amended article
to at least 200 newsgroups. (I think there are close to 24,000 groups
in all.) All you
need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the more money you
make!

: -----DIRECTIONS FOR HOW TO POST TO ON NEWSGROUP BULLETINS-----
STEP 1: You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your
own posting.
Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this letter and drag your
cursor to the
bottom of this letter. Then select 'copy' from the edit menu. This
will copy the
entire letter into the computers temporary memory.
STEP 2: Open a blank 'notepad' or word processor file and place
your cursor at the
top of the blank page. From the 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will
paste a copy of the
letter into notepad so that you can add your name to the list.
STEP 3: Save your new notepad file as a *.txt file. If you want to
do your postings in
different sittings, you'll always have this file to go back to.
STEP 4: Use your internet provider and search engines to find
various newsgroups
(on-line forums, message boards, chat sites, discussions).
STEP 6: Visit these message boards and post this article as a new
message by highlighting
the text of this letter and selecting paste from the edit menu. Fill
in the Subject, and this
will be the header that everyone sees as they scroll through the list
of postings in a particular
group. Then click the post message button. You're done with your
first one!
Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to do is jump
to different newsgroups and
post away. After you get the hang of it, it will only take about 30
seconds for each posting!!
**REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE
MONEY YOU WILL
MAKE!!---BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200**
That's it!
You will begin receiving money from around the world within days!
You may eventually want to rent a P.O. Box due to the large amount of
mail you will receive.
If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a name to use, as long
as the postal service
will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT**
----Now the WHY part----
Out of 200 postings, say I receive only 5 replies (a very low
example). So then I made $5.00
with my name at #5 on the letter. Now, each of the 5 persons who just
sent me $1.00
make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each with my name at #5, and only 5
persons respond to
each of the original 5, that is another $25.00. Then those 25 each
make 200 MINIMUM
posts with my name at #4, and only 5 replies to each, and I will bring
in an additional $125.00!
Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my
name at #3 and only
receive 5 replies each, and I will make an additional $625.00! OK,
now here is the fun part.
Each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM 200 letters with my name at
#2, and they each only
receive 5 replies, that just made me $3,125.00!!! Those 3,125 persons
will all deliver this
message to 200 newsgroups with my name at #1, and if still 5 persons
per 200 newsgroups react,
I will receive an amazing $15,625,00! With an original investment of
only $5.00! AMAZING! When
your name is no longer on the list, you just take the latest posting
in the newsgroups, and send out
another $5.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 5
again. Then start posting
again. That's it! Do you realize that thousands of honest people just
like you all over the world
are joining the internet and reading these articles everyday? So can
you afford $5.00 and see if it
really works?? I think so... People have said, &quot;what if the plan is
played out and no one
sends you the money? So what! What are the chances of that happening
when there are tons of new
honest users who are  joining the internet and newsgroups everyday.
So, are willing to
give it a try? Estimates are about 20,000 to 50,000 new bulletin board
users every day, with
thousands of those joining the internet  itself.
Remember, please play FAIRLY! This ensures a huge circle of
wealth that grows with the
internet audience!!! Everyone benefits!!! Remember to send the FIVE
envelopes to the
above addresses, in order to create the legal service. At first I was
to scared to try this,
but once I researched it, I found that it is totally legal. When you
send the FIVE envelopes
out, you create a service, a legal service. The Internet audience is
expanding all the time.
The audience is like an equity stock on the stock market, continuously
going up.
If you still think this is a fraud, take a few minutes to check it
out, then you'll start raking in
the cash!!!!!!

MAKE QUICK LEGAL EASY MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;
Turn $5.00 into $42,000, WITH HARDLY ANY WORK.... read this to find
out how!!!!
READING THIS COULD CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!! I found this on a bulletin
board and decided to try it. A little while back, I was browsing
through
newsgroups, just like you are now, and came across an article similar
to this
that said you could make thousands of cash within weeks with only an
initial
investment of $5.00!! So I thought, &quot;Yeah right, this must  be a
scam&quot;, but like
most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading.
Before you get skeptical, just take a few minutes to fishish
reading this.
WITH THIS PLAN, YOU REALLY CAN MAKE TONS OF TOTALLY LEGAL, FAST
AND EASY CASH MONEY!! IT WORKS!!! BUT YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW IT CAREFULLY
FOR IT TO WORK CORRECTLY AND IN YOUR FAVOR!!!! WITH ALL THE MONEY
YOU ARE GONNA MAKE, YOU WILL SOON GET EVERTHING YOU'VE  ALWAYS DREAMED
OF!!!!
Here's how it works. All you do is send $1.00 to each of the 5
names and address stated in
the article. You then place your own name and address in the bottom of
the list at #5, and
post the article in at least 200 newsgroups. (There are thousands.) No
catch, that was it. So after
thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about
trying it. I figured, what have
I got to lose except 5 stamps and $5.00, right? Like most of us I was
a little skeptical and a little
worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with
the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161)
and they confirmed that it is indeed legal! Then I invested the
measly $5.00.
Well, GUESS WHAT!!... Within 7 days, I started getting money in
the mail! I was shocked!
I figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in. In my
first week, I made about
$25.00. By the end of the second week I had made a total of over
$1,000! In the third week I had
over $10,000 and it's still growing. This is now my fourth week and I
have made a total of
just over $42,000.00, and it's still coming in rapidly. It's certainly
worth $5.00, and 5 stamps.
By the way, I have spent more than that on the lottery in the last
month!! Let me tell you how this
works and most importantly, why it works....also, make sure you print
a copy of this
article NOW, so you can get the information off of it as you  need
it.

STEP 1: Get 5 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each
piece of paper,
&quot;PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST.&quot;
Also, be sure to include your name and address. Now, get 5 U.S.
$1.00 bills and
place ONE inside EACH of the 5 pieces of paper so the bill will not be
seen through
the envelope, to prevent thievery. Next, place one paper in each of
the 5
envelopes and seal them. You should now have 5 sealed envelopes, each
with a piece
of paper stating the above phrase, your name and address, and a $1.00
bill. What you
are doing is creating a service by this. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!
Mail the 5 envelopes to the following addresses:

:#1) CINDY  MCCLANAHAN
7656  SOMERSET LN.
MANASSAS, VA. 20111

: #2) AILENE  BESS
P.O.BOX 24403
DETROIT, MI 48224

: #3) ILENE  ELLIS
10314 BERKSHIRE  ST.
DETROIT, MI 48224

: #4) GAYLE  MASCIOLI
18432  VANOWEN  ST.
RESEDA, CA  91335

#5) ANGELA  ROCKWELL
P.O.BOX 146
FRANKFORT, ME  04438

STEP 2:   Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above,
move the other
names up (5 becomes 4, 4 becomes 3, etc...) and add YOUR Name as
number 5
on the list.
STEP 3:   Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article
as close to
original as possible. If you do not live in the U.S. or there is a
foreign address, you
must put an international stamp on your envelopes. Now, post your
amended article
to at least 200 newsgroups. (I think there are close to 24,000 groups
in all.) All you
need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the more money you
make!
